in fetuses with mild and moderate left-sided congenital diaphragmatic hernia.", "body": "\nIn fetuses with left-sided isolated congenital diaphragmatic hernia (LCDH), prenatal detection of severe pulmonary hypoplasia is relevant since fetal therapy can improve survival. Moderate and mild hypoplasia still carry a considerable mortality and morbidity risk, but there has been less interest in the accurate prediction of these. In this study on fetuses with moderate or mild CDH, we aimed to investigate: (1) the correlation between intra-pulmonary-artery Doppler (IPaD) findings and mortality, (2) whether adding these improves prediction of mortality based on lung size and liver herniation; and (3) whether the IPaD correlates with early neonatal morbidity.\nThis is a retrospective study including all consecutive fetuses assessed at the BCNatal and UZ Leuven hospitals between 2008 and 2020, with a prenatal diagnosis of isolated, non-severe-LCDH, defined by an observed/expected lung-to-head-ratio (o/e LHR) >25%, and who were expectantly managed during pregnancy followed by standardized neonatal management. An additional criterium was the availability of IPaD measurements. The primary outcome was the correlation between IPaD and mortality. Predictors included o/e LHR, liver herniation, and gestational age at birth. Secondary outcomes were the correlation between IPaD and the presence of pulmonary hypertension (PHT), need for O2 at discharge, and need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). IPaD pulsatility-index (PI) values were converted into z-scores. Logistic regression was performed to investigate the correlations, and the best model was chosen based on the Naegelkerke R2.\nObservations on 70 non-severe-LCDH cases were available. Survival to discharge rate was 54 (77%). In a logistic regression analysis, a higher IPaD-PI was associated with increased mortality [OR 3.96 (95% CI 1.62 - 9.70)], independently from the o/e LHR [0.87 (0.79 - 0.97)]. An IPaD-PI cutoff of >1.8 predicted mortality with a detection rate of 69% and specificity of 93%. Combining o/e LHR and Doppler, the detection rate was 81% at a 10 %-false-positive rate. The IPaD-PI was correlated with PHT [OR 2.20 (95% CI 1.01 - 4.59)] and O2 at discharge [OR 1.9 (95% CI 1.1 - 3.4)], independently of the lung size.\nIn fetuses with mild or moderate LCDH, the IPaD-PI correlated with mortality and morbidity, independently from lung size. A model combining o/e LHR with IPaD-PI identified four out of five cases that eventually died, despite being considered as having non-severe pulmonary hypoplasia.

Multiple constraints that incorporate the potential information of anatomical segmentation extracted by the discriminator can help the model adapt to different modal registration tasks. Through interpatient X-ray chest registration, the deep-supervised training method, and the proposed loss constraint are proved to improve the model's performance and training stability. The experimental results show that our model, compared with state-of-the-art methods, provides a more accurate spatial alignment relationship between different patients' lung organs while ensuring the displacement field's authenticity.

However, the preoperative prediction of nodal metastasis remains a challenge to determine surgical plans and pretreatment decisions in patients with cancers. We proposed a novel deep prediction method with a size-related damper block for nodal metastasis (Nmet) identification from the primary tumor in lung cancer generated by gemstone spectral imaging (GSI) dual-energy computer tomography (CT). The best model is the proposed method trained by the 40 keV dataset achieves an accuracy of 86 % and a Kappa value of 72 % for Nmet prediction. In the experiment, we have 11 different monochromatic images from 40∼140 keV (the interval is 10 keV) for each patient. When we used the model of 40 keV dataset, there has significant difference in other energy levels (unit of keV). Therefore, we apply in 5-fold cross-validation to explain the lower keV is more efficient to predict Nmet of the primary tumor. The result shows that tumor heterogeneity and size contributed to the proposed model to estimate whether absence or presence of nodal metastasis from the primary tumor.\nCopyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Eighty-seven patients (62%) received early LT, while 54 (38%) received delayed (n = 34; 24%) or no LT (n = 20; 14%). LT comprised stereotactic (SRT; n = 40; 34%) or whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT; n = 77; 66%), while neurosurgical resection was carried out in 19 cases.\nMedian overall survival (OS) was 49.1 months for ALK+ and 19.5 months for EGFR+ patients (P = 0.001), with similar median intracranial progression-free survival (icPFS) (15.7 versus 14.0 months, respectively; P = 0.80). Despite the larger and more symptomatic BM (P < 0.001) of patients undergoing early LT, these experienced longer icPFS [hazard ratio (HR) 0.52; P = 0.024], but not OS (HR 1.63; P = 0.12), regardless of the radiotherapy technique (SRT versus WBRT) and number of lesions. High-risk oncogene variants, i.e. non-del19 EGFR mutations and 'short' EML4-ALK fusions (mainly variant 3, E6:A20), were associated with earlier intracranial progression (HR 2.97; P = 0.001). The longer icPFS with early LT was also evident in separate analyses of the EGFR+ and ALK+ subsets.\nDespite preferential use for cases with poor prognostic factors, early LT prolongs the icPFS, but not OS, in TKI-treated EGFR+/ALK+ NSCLC. Considering the lack of survival benefit, and the neurocognitive effects of WBRT, patients presenting with polytopic BM may benefit from delaying radiotherapy, or from radiosurgery of multiple or selected lesions. For SRT candidates, the improved tumor control with earlier radiotherapy should be weighed against the potential toxicity and the enhanced intracranial activity of newer TKI. High-risk EGFR/ALK variants are associated with earlier intracranial failure and identify patients who could benefit from more aggressive management.\nCopyright © 2021 The Author(s).

Triiodothyronine (T3) has been shown to exert a defensive role in many pulmonary diseases, however, rare data are available regarding the role of T3 on silica-induced injury. We constructed an experimental silicosis mouse model and T3 was intraperitoneally administrated after instillation of silica to observe the effect of T3 on silica-induced lung inflammation and fibrosis. Our results showed that the silicosis mouse model was accompanied by changes in thyroid morphology and function, and T3 supplement reduced silica-induced lung damage, inflammation and collagen deposition. The protective properties of T3 on silica-induced lung injury could be partially mediated through thyroid hormone receptors. And the mechanism by which T3 treatment ameliorated silica-induced fibrosis appeared to be via the reduction of glycolysis. Also, T3 could sufficiently postpone the progression of pulmonary fibrosis in established silicosis. Our findings reveal that administration of T3 could down-regulate the inflammatory response, pulmonary fibrosis and other lung damage caused by silica. The reduction of glycolysis may be one of the mechanisms.\nCopyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

During the execution of this program, cellular components, including aggregates, as well as damaged organelles and some proteins are encapsulated in special vesicles known as autophagosomes and subsequently are degraded after fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes. Importantly, at late stages of tumorigenesis cancer cells employ autophagy to sustain proliferation in unfavorable conditions, including anti-cancer drug therapy. E3 ubiquitin ligases play an important role in controlling autophagy. Here we demonstrate that the E3 ligase, a p53-induced RING-H2 protein (Pirh2), is involved in the regulation of autophagy in non-small cell lung cancer cells. Knockdown of Pirh2 decreased the expression of genes involved in all steps of autophagy. Concomitantly, Pirh2 knockdown cell lines exhibited much less of the processed form of LC3 compared to the respective cell lines with normal levels of Pirh2. These results were confirmed by the immune fluorescence microscopy using LC3 antibody and the LysoTracker dye. In agreement with the protective role of autophagy, cells with attenuated expression of Pirh2 were more sensitive to the treatment with doxorubicin.

Endotoxin has been verified as the key risk factor in acute inhalation exposure through the TLR4 (Toll-like receptor 4) signalling pathway. In long-term exposure, endotoxin may also be a risk factor in reclaimed water, but the contribution of other health risk factors should not be underestimated. Wild-type C57BL/6J and TLR4-signalling-pathway-defective mice were used in this study to assess the risk of subchronic inhalation exposure to reclaimed water. Two types of reclaimed water, i.e., secondary effluent and MBR (membrane bioreactor) effluent, were found to induce pulmonary injury and inflammation in the wild-type mice and Tlr4-/- mutants. However, when both mice were exposed to the same concentrations of pure endotoxin in reclaimed water, only the wild-type mice that were treated with high-dose endotoxin showed pulmonary injury. In summary, non-TLR4 signalling pathways are related to lung inflammation caused by long-term exposure to reclaimed water. It is highly possible that pollutants in addition to endotoxin in the reclaimed water can induce chronic inflammation in the lung.\nCopyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, effective ways to eradicate biofilms and thus relieve respiratory tract infection require the development of efficacious agents for biofilm destruction, the design of delivery carriers with biofilm-targeting and/or penetrating abilities for these agents, and the direct delivery of them into the lung. This review provides an in-depth description of biofilm-based infections caused by pulmonary diseases and focuses on current existing agents that are administered by inhalation into the lung to treat biofilm, which include i) inhalable antimicrobial agents and their combinations, ii) non-antimicrobial adjuvants such as matrix-targeting enzymes, mannitol, glutathione, cyclosporin A, and iii) liposomal formulations of anti-biofilm agents. Finally, novel agents that have shown promise against pulmonary biofilms as well as traditional and new devices for pulmonary delivery of anti-biofilm agents into the lung are also discussed.\nCopyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Extracellular vesicle(EVs) are recognized and endocytosed by tissue cells via specific interactions between surface membrane proteins, where after they deliver their molecular cargo. This provides the potential to modify membrane proteins at EV surfaces as a promising means for specific tissue targeting and drug delivery. In this study, we describe a VSVG viral pseudotyping-based approach to load EV membranes with the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein, the key domain in SARS-CoV-2 attachment, fusion and cellular entry. The RBD-tagged EVs can specifically recognize ACE2 receptor on the surface of target cells, which is required for the RBD-tagged EVs cellular uptake and targeting. Further, using the hACE2 transgenic mouse model, we show the RBD-tagged EVs accumulate specifically in the target tissues that highly express ACE2. Finally, we demonstrate that the RBD-tagged EVs that encapsulate siRNAs against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus can specifically target lung tissues and suppress the pseudovirus infection in vivo. Together, our work presents a safe and effective engineered EV system for in vivo targeted delivery of potential antiviral agents into specific tissues which as a therapeutic potential against SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nCopyright © 2021.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for COVID-19, infects cells following recognition and attachment of the viral spike (S) glycoprotein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) transmembrane protein, followed by spike protein cleavage and activation by cell surface transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). In prostate cancer cells, androgen acting on the androgen receptor (AR) increases TMPRSS2 expression, which has led to the hypothesis that androgen-dependent expression of TMPRSS2 in the lung, may increase men's susceptibility to severe COVID-19 and that, accordingly, suppressing androgen production or action may mitigate COVID-19 severity by reducing SARS-CoV-2 amplification. Several ongoing clinical trials are testing the ability of androgen deprivation therapies (ADT) or anti-androgens to mitigate COVID-19.This perspective discusses clinical and molecular advances on the rapidly evolving field of AR action on TMPRSS2 expression and SARS-COV-2 infection, and the potential effect of anti-androgens on COVID-19 severity in male patients.

Hedgehog signalling has been shown to regulate stem cell homeostasis and cancer metastasis, but the mechanisms that activate this pathway in OS are still poorly understood. Here, a series of in vitro and in vivo assays were carried out to explore the function and mechanism of gankyrin regulating Hedgehog signalling in OS. We demonstrated that gankyrin promotes migration, invasion and regulates the expression of some stemness factors by up-regulating Gli1 in OS. Importantly, our data showed an interaction between gankyrin and Gli1. Moreover, gankyrin suppresses the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of Gli1 protein in OS. Gankyrin also significantly promotes the lung metastasis of OS in vivo. Our findings suggest that gankyrin drives metastasis and regulates the expression of some stemness factors in osteosarcoma by activating Hedgehog signalling, indicating that drug screening for compounds targeting gankyrin may contribute to the development of novel and effective therapies for OS.\n© 2021 The Authors.

We analyzed airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), inflammatory cell counts, and the expression levels of NFκB, Nrf2, EPx, and EDN in the lung tissue, as well as the level of ROS in the lung tissue and BALF. The degree of eosinophilia and the levels of IL-5, ROS, and NFκB were significantly increased, whereas the endogenous levels of vitamin E and Nrf2 were decreased in the lung and BALF in the older mice compared to younger mice. The administration of vitamin E attenuated AHR, airway inflammation, and the level of IL-13 and ROS and enhanced the Nrf2 level in the older mice compared to the younger mice. Taken together, vitamin E treatment may have the therapeutic potential through restoration of the Nrf2 level, especially in elderly asthma.\n© 2021 The Authors.

This can be useful for experiments with long image data acquisition times that may be impacted by defocusing resulting from drift of components, e.g. due to changes in temperature or mechanical drift. It is also useful for automated slide scanning or multiwell plate imaging where the sample(s) to be imaged may not be in the same horizontal plane throughout the image data acquisition. To address the impact of (thermal or mechanical) fluctuations over time in the optical autofocus system itself, we utilise a convolutional neural network (CNN) that is trained over multiple days to account for such fluctuations. To address the trade-off between axial precision and range of the autofocus, we implement orthogonal optical readouts with separate CNN training data, thereby achieving an accuracy well within the 600 nm depth of field of our 1.3 numerical aperture objective lens over a defocus range of up to approximately +/-100 μm. We characterise the performance of this autofocus system and demonstrate its application to automated multiwell plate single molecule localisation microscopy. This article is protected by copyright.

This review describes the process of lung cancer-specific MTBs and the transition process from face-to-face tumor boards to virtual ones. The review also focuses on the project organization's description, advantages, and disadvantages. Semi-structured interviews identified five major themes for MTBs: current practice, attitudes, enablers, barriers, and benefits for the MTB. MTB teams exhibited positive responses to modeled data feedback. Virtualization reduces time spent for travel, allowing easier and timely patient discussions. This process requires a secure web platform to assure the respect of patients' privacy and presents the same unanswered problems. The implementation of vMTB also permits the implementation of networks especially in areas with geographical barriers facilitating interaction between large referral cancer centers and tertiary or community hospitals as well as easier access to clinical trial opportunities. Studies aimed to improve preparations, structure, and conduct of MTBs, research methods to monitor their performance, teamwork, and outcomes are also outlined in this article. Analysis of literature shows that MTB participants discuss 5-8 cases per meeting and that the use of a vMTB for lung cancer and in particular stage III NSCLC and complex stage IV cases is widely accepted by most health professionals. Despite still-existing gaps, overall vMTB represents a unique opportunity to optimize patient management in a patient-centered approach.\n", "authors": "Vittorio Gebbia,Aurelia Guarini,Dario Piazza,Alessandro Bertani,Massimiliano Spada,Francesco Verderame,Concetta Sergi,Enrico Potenza,Ivan Fazio,Livio Blasi,Alba La Sala,Gianluca Mortillaro,Elena Roz,Roberto Marchese,Maurizio Chiarenza,Hector Soto-Parra,Maria Rosaria Valerio,Giuseppe Agneta,Carmela Amato,Helga Lipari,Sergio Baldari,Francesco Ferraù,Alfio Di Grazia,Gianfranco Mancuso,Sergio Rizzo,Alberto Firenze", "pmid": "34089169", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:44.504Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:44.504Z", "publish_date": "2021-06-04", "keywords": "Lung cancer", "slug": "virtual-multidisciplinary-tumor-boards-a-narrative", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 1426, "fields": {"title": "AI-based improvement in lung cancer detection on chest radiographs: results of a multi-reader study in NLST dataset.", "body": "\nAssess if deep learning-based artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm improves reader performance for lung cancer detection on chest X-rays (CXRs).\nThis reader study included 173 images from cancer-positive patients (n = 98) and 346 images from cancer-negative patients (n = 196) selected from National Lung Screening Trial (NLST).

Considering current advances in understanding the role of the inflammatory tumor microenvironment, targeting the components of the sarcoma microenvironment, such as TAMs, is a viable strategy. Here, we investigated the effect of PLX3397 (pexidartinib) as a potent inhibitor of the CSF-1 receptor (CSF-1R). PLX3397 was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat tenosynovial giant cell tumor and reprogram TAMs whose infiltration correlates with unfavorable prognosis of sarcomas. First, we confirmed by cytokine arrays of tumor-conditioned media (TCM) that cytokines including CSF-1 are secreted from LM8 osteosarcoma cells and NFSa fibrosarcoma cells. The TCM, like CSF-1, stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), polarized BMDMs toward a M2 (TAM-like) phenotype, and strikingly promoted BMDM chemotaxis. In vitro administration of PLX3397 suppressed pERK1/2 stimulation by CSF-1 or TCM, and reduced M2 polarization, survival, and chemotaxis in BMDMs. Systemic administration of PLX3397 to the osteosarcoma orthotopic xenograft model significantly suppressed the primary tumor growth and lung metastasis, and thus improved metastasis-free survival. PLX3397 treatment concurrently depleted TAMs and FOXP3+ regulatory T cells and, surprisingly, enhanced infiltration of CD8+ T cells into the microenvironments of both primary and metastatic osteosarcoma sites. Our preclinical results show that PLX3397 has strong macrophage- and T cell-modulating effects that may translate into cancer immunotherapy for bone and soft tissue sarcomas.\nCopyright ©2021, American Association for Cancer Research.\n", "authors": "Tomohiro Fujiwara,Mohamed A Yakoub,Andrew Chandler,Alexander B Christ,Guangli Yang,Ouathek Ouerfelli,Vinagolu K Rajasekhar,Aki Yoshida,Hiroya Kondo,Toshiaki Hata,Hiroshi Tazawa,Yildirim Dogan,Malcolm A S Moore,Toshiyoshi Fujiwara,Toshifumi Ozaki,Ed Purdue,John H Healey", "pmid": "34088832", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:44.529Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:44.529Z", "publish_date": "2021-06-04", "keywords": "", "slug": "csf-1csf-1r-signaling-inhibitor-pexidartinib-plx33", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 1436, "fields": {"title": "Radon Knowledge and Practices Among Family Physicians in a High Radon State.", "body": "\nExposure to radon at home is the largest cause of lung cancer after smoking, and the combination of smoking and radon increases lung cancer risk several-fold.

A deeper knowledge about the shift in cellular metabolism of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected cells could provide new insights about its pathogenic and host response and help to diagnose pulmonary involvement. We explored the association between metabolic and structural changes of lung parenchyma in asymptomatic cancer patients with suspected COVID-19 pneumonia, as a potential added diagnostic value of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) scans in this subpopulation. Methods: Within the period of February 19 and May 29, 2020 18F-FDG PET/CT studies were reviewed to identify those cancer patients with suggestive incidental findings of COVID-19 pneumonia. PET studies were interpreted through qualitative (visual) and semiquantitative analysis (measurement of maximum standardized uptake value, SUVmax) evaluating lung findings. Several characteristic signs of COVID-19 pneumonia on computed tomography (CT) were described as COVID-19 Reporting and Data System (CO-RADS) categories (1-6). After comparing SUVmax values of pulmonary infiltrates among different CO-RADS categories, we explored the best potential cut-off values of pulmonary SUVmax against CO-RADS categories as \"gold standard\" result to discard the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. Results: CT signs classified as CO-RADS category 5 or 6 were found in 16/41 (39%) oncological patients derived to multimodal PET/CT imaging. SUVmax was higher in patients with CO-RADS 5 and 6 vs. 4 (6.17±0.82 vs. 3.78±0.50, P = 0.04) and vs. 2 and 3 categories (3.59±0.41, P = 0.01). A specificity of 93.8% (IC 95%: 71.7-99.7%) and an accuracy of 92.9% were obtained when combining a CO-RADS score 5-6 with a SUVmax of 2.45 in pulmonary infiltrates. Conclusion: In asymptomatic cancer patients, the metabolic activity in lung infiltrates is closely associated with several combined tomographic changes characteristic of COVID-19 pneumonia. Multimodal 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging could provide additional information during early diagnosis in selected predisposed patients during pandemic. The prognostic implications of simultaneous radiological and molecular findings in cancer and other high-risk subpopulations for COVID-19 pneumonia deserve further evaluation in prospective researches.\nCopyright © 2021 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Inc.\n", "authors": "Cristina Gamila Wakfie-Corieh,Federico Ferrando-Castagnetto,Alba Maria Blanes Garcia,Marta Garcia Garcia-Esquinas,Aida Ortega Candil,Cristina Rodriguez Rey,Maria Nieves Cabrera Martin,Ana Delgado Cano,Jose Luis Carreras Delgado", "pmid": "34088776", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:44.536Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:44.536Z", "publish_date": "2021-06-04", "keywords": "18F-FDG PET/CT", "slug": "incidental-findings-suggestive-of-covid-19-pneumon", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 1439, "fields": {"title": "Cervicovaginal Tissue Residence Confers a Distinct Differentiation Program upon Memory CD8 T Cells.", "body": "\nTissue-resident memory CD8 T cells (CD8 TRM) are critical for maintaining barrier immunity.

Using localized and systemic infection models, we found that CD8 TRM in the mouse CVT gradually acquired a granzyme B+, TCF-1- phenotype as seen in human CVT. In contrast to CD8 TRM in the gut, these CD8 TRM were not stably maintained regardless of the initial infection route, which led to reductions in local immunity.

Clinical evaluation, baseline function tests, computed tomography and echocardiography were conducted in all subjects. Patients performed consecutive incremental exercise tests with measurement of operating lung volumes and non-invasive measurement of SV, CO and oxygen uptake (VO2) by an inert gas rebreathing method. Biomarkers of systemic inflammation and oxidative stress, tissue damage/repair, cardiac involvement and airway inflammation were measured.\nCOPD patients showed a lower SV/VO2 slope than control subjects, while CO response was compensated by a higher heart rate increase. COPD patients with DH experienced a reduction of SV/VO2 and CO/VO2 compared to those without DH. In COPD patients, the end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) increase was related to SV/VO2 and CO/VO2 slopes, and it was the only independent predictor of cardiac response to exercise. However, in the regression models without EELV, plasma IL-1β and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T were also retained as independent predictors of SV/VO2 slope.\nDynamic hyperinflation decreases the cardiac response to exercise of COPD patients.

A mitochondrial molecule, nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich-repeat-containing protein X1 (NLRX1), represents the only NLR family member that targets this cellular location, implying that NLRX1 probably establishes a fundamental link between mitochondrial functions and cellular physiology. However, the significance of NLRX1 function in cellular senescence, a key conceptual constituent in aging biology, is yet to be defined. Here, we demonstrate that molecular hallmarks involved in aging biology including NAD+ decline, and activation of mTOR, p53, and p16INK4A are significantly enhanced in NLRX1 deficiency in vitro. Mechanistic studies of replicative cellular senescence in the presence or absence of NLRX1 in vitro reveal that NLRX1-deficient fibroblasts fail to maintain optimal NAD+ /NADH ratio, which instigates the decline of SIRT1 and the activation of mTOR, p16INK4A , and p53, leading to the increase in senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-β-gal)-positive cells. Importantly, the enhanced cellular senescence response in NLRX1 deficiency is significantly attenuated by pharmacological inhibition of mTOR signaling in vitro. Finally, our in vivo murine studies reveal that NLRX1 decreases with age in murine lungs and NLRX1 deficiency in vivo accelerates pulmonary functional and structural changes that recapitulate the findings observed in human aging lungs. In conclusion, the current study provides evidence for NLRX1 as a crucial regulator of cellular senescence and in vivo lung aging.\n© 2021 The Authors.

Periodic in situ imaging revealed increased luciferase activity in the lungs of 20 Gy thoracic irradiated, but not 8 Gy total-body irradiated (TBI) mice beginning at day 75 and increasing to day 170. In serial sections of explanted lungs, senescent cells appeared in the same areas as did fibrosis in the 20 Gy thoracic irradiated, but not the 8 Gy TBI group. Lungs from 8 Gy TBI mice at one year did show increased RNA levels for p16, p21, p19 and TGF-β. Individual senescent cells in 20 Gy irradiated mouse lung included those with epithelial, endothelial, fibroblast and hematopoietic cell biomarkers. Rare senescent cells in the lungs of 8 Gy TBI mice at one year were of endothelial phenotype. Long-term bone marrow cultures (LTBMCs) were established at either day 60 or one year after 8 Gy TBI. In freshly removed marrow at both times after irradiation, there were increased senescent cells. In LTBMCs, there were increased senescent cells in both weekly harvested single cells and in colonies of multilineage hematopoietic progenitor cells producing CFU-GEMM (colony forming unit-granulocyte, erythrocyte, monocyte/macrophage, megakaryocyte) that were formed in secondary cultures when these single cells were plated in semisolid media. LTBMCs from TBI mice produced fewer CFU-GEMM; however, the relative percentage of senescent cell-containing colonies was increased as measured by both p16-luciferase and β-galactosidase. Therefore, 20 Gy thoracic radiation, as well as 8 Gy TBI, induces senescent cells in the lungs. With bone marrow, 8 Gy TBI induced senescence in both hematopoietic cells and in colony-forming progenitors. The p16+/LUC mouse strain provides a valuable system in which to compare the kinetics of radiation-induced senescence between organs in vivo, and to evaluate the potential role of senescent cells in irradiation pulmonary fibrosis.\n©2021 by Radiation Research Society.\n", "authors": "Michael W Epperly,Donna Shields,Renee Fisher,Wen Hou,Hong Wang,Diala Fatima Hamade,Amitava Mukherjee,Joel S Greenberger", "pmid": "34087939", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:44.613Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:44.613Z", "publish_date": "2021-06-04", "keywords": "", "slug": "radiation-induced-senescence-in-p16luc-mouse-lung-", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 1469, "fields": {"title": "Successful treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia in a 92-year-old man using all-trans retinoic acid combined with oral arsenic: A case report.", "body": "\nAcute promyelocytic leukemia is a special subtype of acute myeloid leukemia.

Serum Amyloid A (SAA) is an acute-phase protein and a marker of persistent inflammation. We hypothesized that circulating SAA may predict outcomes in advanced non-small cell lung (aNSCLC) patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 ICB.\nThis retrospective study included 91 aNSCLC patients who received anti-PD-(L)1 monotherapy in Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (Guangzhou, China) between August 2016 and June 2018. We examined the impact of circulating SAA at baseline and 8 (±2) weeks later on overall survival (OS). X-tile program was used to determine the cut-off values which optimized the significance of the split between Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Kaplan-Meier methodology and Cox regression analyses were conducted for survival analyses.\nThe optimal cut-off value of baseline SAA for OS stratification was 137.6 mg/L. In univariate analysis, both high level of baseline SAA (hazard ratio [HR], 2.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.47-5.18; P = 0.002) and lack of early SAA descent (HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.11-2.06; P = 0.009) were significantly associated with inferior OS. In multivariate analysis, gender, smoking status, performance status, liver metastasis, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, baseline SAA and early changes in SAA independently predicted OS (all with P < 0.05). A combined baseline SAA ≥ 137.6 mg/L and without early SAA descent identified a small cohort with remarkably worse OS (median, 3.2 months).\nBoth high baseline and lack of early decline in circulating SAA are significantly associated with inferior outcomes in aNSCLC patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 ICB. Combined these two SAA indexes provided improved risk stratification. The prognostic value of this simple, readily-available, and cost-effective biomarker warrants larger, prospective validation before definitive recommendation can be made.\nCopyright © 2021.

This hypothesis is based on the fact that, in addition to promoting the increase in red blood cells, EPO is an anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and protective factor in several non-erythropoietic tissues. Furthermore, EPO promotes nitric oxide production in the hypoxic lung and stimulates ventilation by interacting with the respiratory centers of the brainstem. Given that EPO in the blood is increased at high-altitude, we evaluated the serum levels of EPO in critical patients with COVID-19 at \"Hospital Agramont\" in the city of El Alto (4,150 masl) in Bolivia. A total of 16 patients, 15 men, one woman, with a mean age of 55.8 ± 8.49 years, admitted to the Intensive Care Unit were studied. All patients were permanent residents of El Alto, with no travel history below 3,000 masl for at least one year. Blood samples were collected upon admission to the ICU. Serum EPO concentration was assessed using an ELISA kit, and a standard technique determined hemoglobin concentration. Only half of the observed patients survived the disease. Remarkably, fatal cases showed 2.5 times lower serum EPO than survivors (2.78 ± 0.8643 mU/ml vs 7.06 ± 2.713 mU/ml; p = 0.0096), and 1.24 times lower hemoglobin levels (13.96 ± 2.56 g/dL vs 17.41 ± 1.61 g/dL; p = 0.0159). While the number of cases evaluated in this work is low, our findings strongly warrant further investigation of EPO levels in COVID-19 patients at high and low altitudes.

In our study, a cerebral I/R model in mice was established by 1-h middle cerebral artery occlusion and 24-h reperfusion (1-h MCAO/24-h R). Prior to it, mice were gavaged with BAK (2.5 or 5 mg/kg) per day for 5 days. BAK pre-treatment improved neurological deficit, and reduced infarct volume, cerebral edema and neuronal injury in MCAO/R-injured mice. BAK decreased the number of Iba1-immunoreactive cells in the brain, indicating a reduction of microglial activation. BAK also reduced the expressions of NLRP3, ASC, cleaved-caspase-1, IL-1β and IL-18. BAK triggered Nrf2 nuclear accumulation and elevated HO-1 level. Further, the role of BAK was explored in BV-2 microglia with 3-h oxygen-glucose deprivation/24-h reperfusion (3-h OGD/24-h R). It was found that the functions of BAK in vitro were consistent with those in vivo, as manifested by reduced NLRP3 inflammasome and activated Nrf2 signaling. In addition, BV-2 cells were treated with Brusatol, an Nrf2 inhibitor. Results showed that Brusatol partially reversed the protective effect of BAK on OGD/R-injured BV-2 cells, further confirming that BAK might exhibit its anti-inflammatory property via activating Nrf2 signaling. In short, BAK is more meaningful in improving cerebral ischemic injury through suppressing NLRP3-mediated inflammatory response and activating the Nrf2 signaling pathway.\nCopyright © 2021.

Furthermore, we investigated the anti-tumorigenic mechanisms of yamabudo juice and DBQ. NNK is known to be a DNA-methylating and alkylating agent; thus, we investigated the anti-tumorigenic mechanisms of yamabudo juice and DBQ in relation to DNA methylation. Pretreatment with yamabudo-fr or DBQ dose-dependently decreased formation of O6-methylguanine and N7-methylguanine in DNA of the A549 human lung epithelial-like cell line treated with a methylating agent, 1-methyl-3-nitro-1-nitrosoguanidine. Yamabudo juice and DBQ inhibited the mutagenicity of NNK in the Ames test using Salmonella typhimurium TA1535 but not S. typhimurium YG7108, an alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase-deficient strain (same as TA1535 but Δadast::Kmr, Δogtst::Cmr). Yamabudo juice and DBQ might accelerate the repair of DNA damage caused by NNK and reduce DNA damage to cells. We also investigated the effects of yamabudo juice and DBQ on signaling pathways in A549 cells. With or without epidermal growth factor stimulation, phosphorylation of Erk1/2, Akt and Stat3 in A549 cells was significantly decreased in the presence of yamabudo juice or DBQ, indicating that yamabudo juice and DBQ suppressed PI3K/AKT, MAPK/ERK and JAK/STAT3 signaling pathways. These results suggest that both initiation and growth/progression steps in carcinogenesis, especially anti-oxidant effects, stimulation of repair of alkyl DNA adducts and suppressed growth signaling pathways are potential anti-tumorigenic targets of yamabudo juice and DBQ in NNK-induced lung tumorigenesis.\nCopyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

HL, also called goldthread, was frequently used for the treatment of typhoid, tuberculosis, epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis, pertussis, and other lung-related diseases. Modern research has shown that HL and its main compounds also have anti-tumor effects. However, studies have not reported whether its main compounds inhibit Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) development and progression.\nThis study aimed to find out the potential targets and mechanisms of Oxyepiberberine (OPB) isolated from HL in the treatment of NSCLC, using network pharmacology and biological experimental.\nSilica gel chromatography column was used to isolate OPB from HL, and the structure of OPB was elucidated using different spectroscopic analysis methods, including 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), 13C-NMR and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI/MS). MTT assay was performed to determine cell proliferation of OPB on A549, H1975 and BEAS-2B cells. Then, the potential targets, pathways and hub genes of OPB for treating NSCLC were screened out through network pharmacology. Based on the results of network pharmacology, core targets of OPB for treating NSCLC were docking with OPB via molecular docking. Wound healing, plate clone, Hoechst staining, and western blot assay were used to verify the function of OPB in treatment of NSCLC.\nOPB was isolated from the HL, its molecular formula was identified as C20H17NO5. Through MTT, OPB significantly inhibited the proliferation of H1975 cells and A549 cells, and A549 was chosen as the test cancer cell. Through network pharmacology, 22 potential targets, 156 related-pathways, and 6 hub genes were screened out. The results of molecular docking showed that SRC, BRAF, and MMP9 were the core targets of OPB against NSCLC. Through biological experimental, it was found that OPB inhibited growth and migration of A549 cells. In addition, OPB induced apoptosis in A549 cells. Through western blot assay, the expressions of Src, ERK1/2 and other four proteins were down-regulated, which suggested that OPB inhibited the proliferation of lung cancer cells by down-regulating SRC-FAK-RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway, so as to achieve the anti-NSCLC effect.\nOur study demonstrated that anti-NSCLC effect of OPB through network and experiments, which provided a theoretical basis for the clinical antitumor of OPB, and provided a foundation for further study of OPB.\nCopyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we found that heme levels were increased in osimertinib resistant EGFR-mutant NSCLC cell lines and plasma heme levels were also elevated in osimertinib-treated EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients. The antimalarial drug dihydroartemisinin (DHA), which has anticancer effects and requires heme, was tested to determine its potential to revert osimertinib resistance. DHA downregulated the expression of heme oxygenase 1 and inhibited cell proliferation in osimertinib-resistant EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells (PC9-GR4-AZD1), which was further enhanced by addition of 5-aminolevulinic acid, protoporphyrin IX and hemin. DHA was synergistic with osimertinib in inhibiting cell proliferation and colony formation of all osimertinib-resistant cell lines tested. Combination treatment with osimertinib and DHA also increased the levels of ROS, downregulated the phosphorylation or protein levels of several RTKs that often are overexpressed in osimertinib-resistant EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells, and inhibited tumor growth without toxicity in a PC9-GR4-AZD1 xenograft mouse model. The results suggest that DHA is able to reverse the resistance to osimertinib in EGFR-mutant NSCLC by elevating ROS level and impair heme metabolism.\nCopyright © 2021.

These treatments have demonstrated improved efficacy and often a more favourable toxicity profile compared to standard cytotoxic chemotherapy. There are considerable differences among responders, with some patients experiencing durable long-term disease control and even remission. Given this variability, determining a proper biomarker to select patients for ICI therapy has become increasingly important. The only biomarker proven to be predictive of overall survival benefit with ICI therapy is PD-L1 expression level measured by immunohistochemistry. Several attempts have been made to identify different predictive biomarkers. One of the most intriguing and divisive is tumor mutational burden (TMB). TMB represents the number of mutations per megabase (Mut/Mb) of DNA that were sequenced in a specific cancer. With a higher number of mutations detected, and consequentially an increase in the number neo-epitopes, then it is more likely that one or more of those neo-antigens could be immunogenic and trigger a T cell response. Initially, TMB was identified as a biomarker for ICIs in melanoma and subsequent studies suggested a possible clinical role for TMB in non-small cell lung cancer. The initial data were not confirmed in a prospective study assessing OS as the primary endpoint. Recently, the FDA has approved pembrolizumab in all cancers with a TMB > 10Mut/Mb[12] based on findings from the phase 2 KEYNOTE-158. Much criticism has emerged about this pan-cancer approval, in particular about the use of TMB as biomarker to select patients. Here we review the data about the importance and role of TMB as possible pan-cancer one-size-fits-all biomarker. We highlight the strengths and intrinsic limitations of such a complex biomarker and its adoption in the daily practice.\nCopyright © 2021.

In the subacute phase, 42 CMR studies (5821 patients) showed that a pooled prevalence of myocarditis, takotsubo syndrome and cardiomyopathy of 26% (95% CI: 12% to 40%), 11% (95% CI: 5% to 25%), and 7% (95% CI: 1% to 19%), respectively. In 12 studies on thrombophilia screening (n = 834), the pooled prevalence of thrombotic disorder was ~11% (95% CI: 7%% to 25%). In conclusion, the pathophysiology of MINOCA can be established in the majority of cases using both invasive and non-invasive tools to provide direction for appropriate management.\nCopyright © 2021.

CAC is an established predictor of cardiovascular disease (CVD), with emerging data also supporting independent predictive value for cancer. The association of CAC with risk for individual cancer subtypes is unknown.\nWe included 6271 MESA participants, aged 45-84 and without known CVD or self-reported history of cancer. There were 777 incident cancer cases during mean follow-up of 12.9 ± 3.1 years. Lung and colorectal cancer (186 cases) were grouped based on their strong overlap with CVD risk profile; prostate (men) and ovarian, uterine, and breast cancer (women) were considered as sex-specific cancers (in total 250 cases). Incidence rates and Fine and Gray competing risks models were used to assess relative risk of cancer-specific outcomes stratified by CAC groups or Log(CAC+1). The mean age was 61.7 ± 10.2 years, 52.7% were women, and 36.5% were White. Overall, all-cause cancer incidence increased with CAC scores, with rates per 1000 person-years of 13.1 [95% confidence interval (CI): 11.7-14.7] for CAC = 0 and 35.8 (95% CI: 30.2-42.4) for CAC ≥400. Compared with CAC = 0, hazards for those with CAC ≥400 were increased for lung and colorectal cancer in men [subdistribution hazard ratio (SHR): 2.2 (95% CI: 1.1-4.7)] and women [SHR: 2.2 (95% CI: 1.0-4.6)], but not significantly for sex-specific cancers across sexes.\nCAC scores were associated with cancer risk in both sexes; however, this was stronger for lung and colorectal when compared with sex-specific cancers. Our data support potential synergistic use of CAC scores in the identification of both CVD and lung and colorectal cancer risk.\nPublished on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

Previous studies have shown that many lncRNAs are associated with the occurrence and development of BCa. However, few studies have combined multiple lncRNAs to predict the prognosis of early-stage BCa patients.\nSystematic and comprehensive analysis of data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was conducted to identify lncRNA signatures with prognostic value in BCa. Additionally, the relative expression levels of the 8 lncRNA of several BCa cell lines were detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and the results were substituted into a risk score formula. Finally, migration assays were used to verify the result from prognostic analysis according to the risk scores among cell lines with different risk scores.\nOur study included 808 BCa patients with complete clinical data. A panel of 8 lncRNAs was identified using Wilcox tests as different between normal and tumor tissue of the BCa patients. This panel was used to analyze the survival of BCa patients. Patients with low risk scores had greater overall survival (OS) than those with high risk scores. Multivariate Cox regression analyses demonstrated that the lncRNA signature was an independent prognostic factor. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) suggested that the lncRNAs might be involved in several molecular signaling pathways implicated in BCa such as the DNA replication pathway, the cell cycle pathway, and the pentose phosphate pathway. Validation experiments in breast cancer cells to test cell migration by using wound-healing assays supported the results of the model.\nOur study demonstrated that a panel of 8 lncRNAs has the potential to be used as an independent prognostic biomarker of BCa.\n", "authors": "Lili Zhu,Kang Cui,Lanling Weng,Pu Yu,Yabing Du,Tengfei Zhang,Hong Liu,Bingjie Li,Wang Ma", "pmid": "34086679", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:44.714Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:44.715Z", "publish_date": "2021-06-04", "keywords": "", "slug": "a-panel-of-8-lncrna-predicts-prognosis-of-breast-c", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 1507, "fields": {"title": "The functional role of oncogenic lncRNA BCAR4 for cancer outcome.", "body": "\nLong non-coding RNA (lncRNA) breast cancer anti-estrogen resistance 4 (BCAR4) is a characterized oncogenic lncRNA in different cancers.

Experimental animal studies have consistently showed that exposure to a high fraction of inspired oxygen causes respiratory failure and early death. Human autopsy studies from the 1960s purported to provide histologic evidence of pulmonary oxygen toxicity in the form of diffuse alveolar damage. However, concomitant ventilator-induced lung injury and/or other causes of acute lung injury may explain these findings. While some observational studies in general populations of critically adults showed higher mortality in association with higher oxygen exposures, this finding has not been consistent. For some specific populations, such as those with cardiac arrest, studies have suggested harm from targeting supraphysiologic PaO2s. More recently, randomized clinical trials of arterial oxygenation targets in narrower physiologic ranges were conducted in critically ill adult patients. Though two smaller trials came to opposite conclusions, the two largest of these trials showed no differences in clinical outcomes in study groups that received conservative versus liberal oxygen targets, suggesting that either strategy is reasonable. It is possible that some strategies are of benefit in some sub-populations, and this remains an important ongoing area of research. Because of the ubiquity of oxygen supplementation in critically ill adults, even small treatment effects could have a large impact on a global scale.\n", "authors": "Chad H Hochberg,Matthew W Semler,Roy G Brower", "pmid": "34086536", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:44.720Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:44.720Z", "publish_date": "2021-06-04", "keywords": "Oxygen Toxicity", "slug": "oxygen-toxicity-in-critically-ill-adults", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 1509, "fields": {"title": "New Avenues for Anti-inflammatory Signaling of Nur77 in Acute Lung Injury.", "body": "", "authors": "Natascha Sommer,Oleg Pak,Matthias Hecker", "pmid": "34086527", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:44.723Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:44.723Z", "publish_date": "2021-06-04", "keywords": "", "slug": "new-avenues-for-anti-inflammatory-signaling-of-nur", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 1510, "fields": {"title": "Erratum: Sirtuin 1 Promotes Hyperoxide-Induced Lung Epithelial Cell Death Independent of NF-E2-Related Factor 2 Activation.", "body": "", "authors": "", "pmid": "34086526", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:44.726Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:44.726Z", "publish_date": null, "keywords": "", "slug": "erratum-sirtuin-1-promotes-hyperoxide-induced-lung", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 1511, "fields": {"title": "Reduced-intensity conditioning-based hematopoietic cell transplantation for dyskeratosis congenita: Single-center experience and literature review.", "body": "\nBone marrow failure in dyskeratosis congenita (DKC) is progressive, and allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is the only curative treatment. However, outcomes after HCT are suboptimal because of mucosal, vascular, pulmonary, and hepatic fragility, which can be exacerbated by chemotherapy conditioning and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). These toxicities can be mitigated by reducing the intensity of the conditioning regimen.\nWe performed a retrospective analysis on pediatric patients with DKC who underwent HCT at our institution between 2008 and 2019.\nWe identified nine patients (median age, 5.7 years) who underwent HCT with a fludarabine-based reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of tacrolimus plus mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (n  =  8), tacrolimus/pentostatin (n  =  1), or cyclosporine/MMF (n  =  1). The median time to neutrophil engraftment was 19 days (range, 13-26 days), and the median time to platelet engraftment was 18 days (range, 17-43 days). Lung function, as measured by spirometry in six patients, remained stable during post-HCT observation. Six patients (67%) remain alive, with a median follow-up of 73.5 months.\nBecause of toxicity after myeloablative conditioning, RIC is becoming standard for HCT in DKC.

It has been hypothesized that this malignant metabolic phenotype supports cancer growth and metastasis, and that reversal of this so-called \"Warburg effect\" may selectively harm cancer cells. Conversion of glucose to lactate can be reduced by ablation or inhibition of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), the enzyme responsible for conversion of pyruvate to lactate at the endpoint of glycolysis. Recently developed inhibitors of LDH provide new opportunities to investigate the role of this metabolic pathway in cancer. Here we show that magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging of hyperpolarized pyruvate and its metabolites in models of breast and lung cancer reveal that inhibition of LDH was readily visualized through reduction in label exchange between pyruvate and lactate, while genetic ablation of the LDH-A isoform alone had smaller effects. During the acute phase of LDH inhibition in breast cancer, no discernible bicarbonate signal was observed and small signals from alanine were unchanged.\n© 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n", "authors": "Gopal Varma,Pankaj Seth,Patricia Coutinho de Souza,Cody Callahan,Jocelin Pinto,Manushka Vaidya,Olmo Sonzogni,Vikas Sukhatme,Gerburg M Wulf,Aaron K Grant", "pmid": "34086382", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:44.731Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:44.731Z", "publish_date": "2021-06-04", "keywords": "GNE140", "slug": "visualizing-the-effects-of-lactate-dehydrogenase-l", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 1513, "fields": {"title": "Improving RNA Crystal Diffraction Quality by Postcrystallization Treatment.", "body": "\nThe crystallization and structural determination of large RNAs and their complexes remain major bottlenecks in the mechanistic analysis of cellular and viral RNAs.

Clinical findings of the children with imaging findings of azygos lobe were collected and analyzed. In this study, 50 children with azygos lobe were included. A total of 28% cases were found to have azygos lobe incidentally. The remaining 72% cases were diagnosed when they presented with respiratory symptoms including cough (36%), fever (34%), wheezing (18%), dyspnea (14%), and cyanosis (8%). Congenital heart disease, Down syndrome, and other respiratory malformations were also found in a small proportion of these patients. Only 7 (14%) patients suffered from azygos lobe infection and were clinically cured after reasonable anti-infective treatment. Compared with the non-infected group, no valuable risk factors were found to be related to azygos lobe infection. All children who had azygos lobe infections responded to appropriate antibiotics therapy. There was no evidence that an azygos lobe was associated with recurrent infections.Conclusion: The clinical characteristics of children with azygos lobe are nonspecific and diagnosis relies on chest imaging. Some congenital abnormalities may be complicated with azygos lobe. It is reasonable to keep watch over those patients without symptoms. What is Known: • An azygos lobe is a congenital variation of the lung. • Azygos lobe can mimic various pathological conditions leading to misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment in adults, which presents challenges during thoracic surgical interventions.

Building off recent developments in high-frequency four-dimensional ultrasound (4DUS) imaging, we have applied this technology to study cardiac dysfunction progression in a murine model of metabolic cardiomyopathy. Cardiac knockout of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (Cpt2M-/-) in mice hinders cardiomyocyte bioenergetic metabolism of long-chain fatty acids, and leads to progressive cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. The proposed analysis provides a standardized approach to measure localized wall kinematics and simultaneously extract metrics of global cardiac function, LV morphometry, regional circumferential strain, and regional longitudinal strain from an interpolated 4D mesh of the endo- and epi-cardial boundaries. Comparison of metric changes due to aging suggest that circumferential strain at the base and longitudinal strain along the posterior wall are most sensitive to disease progression. We further introduce a novel Hybrid Strain Index (HSI) that incorporates information from these two regions and may have greater utility to characterize disease progression relative to other extracted metrics. Future work will look to apply these methods to additional disease models and further demonstrate the utility of metrics derived from 4DUS imaging and strain mapping.\n", "authors": "Frederick W Damen,John P Salvas,Andrea S Pereyra,Jessica M Ellis,Craig J Goergen", "pmid": "34085843", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:44.761Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:44.761Z", "publish_date": "2021-06-04", "keywords": "contractility", "slug": "improving-characterization-of-hypertrophy-induced-", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 1525, "fields": {"title": "Metalloproteinases and Their Inhibitors Are Associated with Pulmonary Arterial Stiffness and Ventricular Function in Pediatric Pulmonary Hypertension.", "body": "\nDisturbed balance between matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their respective tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) is a well-recognized pathophysiologic component of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).

Long-term exposure to hyperglycemia causes oxidative stress, which leads to cardiomyocyte dysfunction. Previous studies established the importance of thioredoxin-Interacting protein (Txnip) in cellular redox homeostasis and glucose metabolism. Txnip is a highly glucose-responsive molecule that interacts with the catalytic center of reduced thioredoxin and inhibits the antioxidant function of thioredoxin. Here, we show that the molecular interaction between Txnip and thioredoxin plays a pivotal role in the regulation of redox balance in the diabetic myocardium. High glucose increased Txnip expression, decreased thioredoxin activities, and caused oxidative stress in cells. The Txnip-thioredoxin complex was detected in cells with overexpressing wild-type Txnip but not Txnip cysteine 247 to serine (C247S) mutant that disrupts the intermolecular disulfide bridge. Then, diabetes was induced in cardiomyocyte-specific Txnip C247S knock-in mice and their littermate control animals by injections of streptozotocin (STZ). Prolonged hyperglycemia up-regulated myocardial Txnip expression in both genotypes. The absence of Txnip's inhibition of thioredoxin in Txnip C247S mutant hearts promoted mitochondrial anti-oxidative capacities in cardiomyocytes, thereby protecting the heart from oxidative damage by diabetes. Stress hemodynamic analysis uncovered that Txnip C247S knock-in hearts have a greater left ventricular contractile reserve than wild-type hearts under STZ-induced diabetic conditions. These results provide novel evidence that Txnip serves as a regulator of hyperglycemia-induced cardiomyocyte toxicities through direct inhibition of thioredoxin, and identify the single cysteine residue in Txnip as a therapeutic target for diabetic injuries.\n", "authors": "Nobuhiro Mukai,Yoshinobu Nakayama,Syed Amir Abdali,Jun Yoshioka", "pmid": "34085839", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:44.769Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:44.769Z", "publish_date": "2021-06-04", "keywords": "Metabolism", "slug": "cardiomyocyte-specific-txnip-c247s-mutation-improv", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 1528, "fields": {"title": "Feasibility of Using the O-Arm Imaging System During ENB-rEBUS-guided Peripheral Lung Biopsy: A Dual-center Experience.", "body": "\nThere is a paucity of real-time imaging modalities available for the bronchoscopic biopsy of peripheral lung nodules.

Each programmed motion was imaged using 4D CT and 4D CBCT. The images were processed to auto segment the target. For sine motion, the target centroid at each phase was fitted to a sinusoidal curve to evaluate equivalence in amplitude between the two imaging modalities. The patient waveform motion was evaluated based on the average 4D data sets.\nThe mean difference and root-mean-square-error between the two modalities for sine motion were -0.35 ± 0.22 and 0.60 mm, respectively, with 4D CBCT slightly overestimating amplitude compared with 4D CT. The two imaging methods were determined to be significantly equivalent within ±1 mm based on two one-sided t tests (p < 0.001). For patient-specific motion, the mean difference was 1.5 ± 2.1 (0.8 ± 0.6 without outlier), 0.4 ± 0.3, and 0.8 ± 0.6 mm for superior/inferior (SI), anterior/posterior (AP), and left/right (LR), respectively.\nIn cases where 4D CT is used to image mobile tumors, 4D CBCT is an attractive localization method due to its assessment of motion with respect to 4D CT, particularly for lung SBRT treatments where accuracy is paramount.\n© 2021 The Authors.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa-mediated nuclear ∆2-HDE generation, and H3/H4 histone acetylation was attenuated by S1PL inhibitors in MLE-12 cells and human bronchial epithelial cells. In vitro, the addition of exogenous ∆2-HDE (100-10,000 nM) to lung epithelial cell nuclear preparations inhibited HDAC1/2 activity, and increased acetylation of Histone H3 and H4, whereas similar concentrations of S1P did not show a significant change. In addition, incubation of ∆2-HDE with rHDAC1 generated five different amino acid adducts as detected by LC-MS/MS; the predominant adduct being ∆2-HDE with lysine residues of HDAC1.

Human lung epithelial BEAS-2B cells received lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (0, 1, 5, and 10 mg/L) treatment for 16 h, establishing in vitro pneumonia model. USP14 protein and mRNA levels in LPS-injured lung epithelial cells were separately assessed using western blot and RT-qPCR analysis. Lung epithelial cells were transfected with siRNA-USP14 or OV-USP14 to perform gain- or loss-of-function experiments. CCK-8 assay was applied to assess cell viability. TUNEL staining and western blot analysis were adopted to determine cell apoptosis. In addition, release of inflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide (NO) was detected using the commercial kits. Meanwhile, PARP-1 protein levels in LPS-injured lung epithelial cells were detected by performing western blot assay. Moreover, Co-IP assay was utilized for detection of the interaction between USP14 and PARP-1. The regulatory effects of PARP-1 on USP14 function in LPS-injured lung epithelial cells were also investigated. LPS dose-dependently reduced viability of lung epithelial cells and elevated USP14 protein. USP14 combined with PARP-1 and increased PARP-1 expression. USP14 elevation exacerbated inflammatory injury and boosted the apoptosis of LPS-injured lung epithelial cells, which was reversed upon downregulation of PARP-1. To sum up, USP14 promotion exacerbated inflammatory injury and boosted the apoptosis of LPS-injured lung epithelial cells by upregulating PARP-1 expression.

The paucity of precise replication in genetic studies of asthma is partly explained by the existence of numerous gene-environment interactions. Another important issue which is often overlooked is that of time of the assessment of the primary outcome(s) and the relevant environmental exposures. Most large GWASs use the broadest possible definition of asthma to increase the sample size, but the unwanted consequence of this is increased phenotypic heterogeneity, which dilutes effect sizes.

We sought to determine the degree of, and correlation between, telomere shortening and DNA damage in different cell types involved in the pathogenesis of progressive fibrosing interstitial lung disease. Telomere length and DNA damage were quantified, using combined fluorescence in situ hybridisation and immunofluorescence staining techniques, in AT2 cells, club cells and myofibroblasts of controls and patients with pulmonary fibrosis and a telomerase reverse transcriptase mutation (TERT-PF), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (fHP).

In vitro, we found significantly shorter telomeres and higher DNA damage levels only in AT2 surrogate cell lines treated with telomerase inhibitor BIBR1532.

These findings suggest that cell type-specific telomere shortening and DNA damage may help to discriminate between different drivers of fibrogenesis.\nCopyright ©ERS 2021.\n", "authors": "Aernoud A van Batenburg,Karin M Kazemier,Matthijs F M van Oosterhout,Joanne J van der Vis,Jan C Grutters,Roel Goldschmeding,Coline H M van Moorsel", "pmid": "34084786", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:44.832Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:44.832Z", "publish_date": "2021-05-31", "keywords": "", "slug": "telomere-shortening-and-dna-damage-in-culprit-cell", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 1552, "fields": {"title": "Safety data in randomised real-world evidence studies: Salford Lung Study learnings.", "body": "\nEvidence to support clinical decision making must be based on safety data that have been captured, analysed and interpreted in a robust and reliable way.

However, elements that underpin the design of RRWE studies can have a significant impact upon the analysis, interpretation and implications of safety data. In this narrative review, we use data from the Salford Lung Study; two prospective, 12-month, open-label, parallel-group, phase III randomised controlled trials conducted in primary care in the UK; to highlight the importance of capturing treatment modifications when attempting to evaluate safety events according to actual treatment exposure. We demonstrate that analysing safety data by actual treatment received (i.e. accounting for the treatment modifications that occur routinely in the primary care setting) provides additional insight beyond analysing according to randomised treatment strategy only. It is therefore proposed that understanding of safety data from RRWE trials can be optimised by analysing both by randomised group and by actual treatment received.\nCopyright ©The authors 2021.\n", "authors": "Catherine Harvey,Ashley Woodcock,Jørgen Vestbo,Courtney Crim,Lucy Frith,Nawar Diar Bakerly,John P New,Claire Williams,Hanaa Elkhenini,Nasir Majeed,Glenn Cardwell,Susan Collier,Loretta Jacques,Joanne Fletcher", "pmid": "34084785", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:44.834Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:44.834Z", "publish_date": "2021-05-31", "keywords": "", "slug": "safety-data-in-randomised-real-world-evidence-stud", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 1553, "fields": {"title": "Lung volume reduction in emphysema: a pragmatic prospective cohort study.", "body": "\nLimited guidance exists for the implementation of lung volume reduction interventions in routine clinical care.

Primary outcome was the proportion of subjects with a forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) improvement of ⩾100 mL at 3-month follow-up. Changes in FEV1, residual volume (RV), 6-min walk distance (6MWD) and quality of life (St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ)) were evaluated at 6-month follow-up.

Smoking C57Bl/6N mice had higher enlargement of alveoli, deposition of collagen and mucus production, associated to the release of IL-1-like cytokines, such as IL-1α and IL-1β at early time points and IL-18 at later time points. AIM2 expression was higher in lung recruited dendritic cells and macrophages in smoking mice, associated to the activation of caspase-11, rather than caspase-1. In support,129Sv mice, which are dysfunctional for caspase-11, had lower collagen deposition and mucus production, associated to lower release of IL-1-like and fibrotic TGFβ. Interestingly, higher expression of AIM2 in non-cancerous tissue of smoking COPD adenocarcinoma patients was correlated to a higher hazard ratio of poor survival rate than in patients who presented lower levels of AIM2.

Therefore, there is a need to identify the underlying mechanisms of resistance to EGFR-TKIs. In the present study, colony formation and MTT assays were performed to investigate cell viability following treatment with icotinib. Gene Expression Omnibus datasets were used to identify genes associated with resistance. Wound healing and Transwell assays were used to detect cell migration and invasion with icotinib treatment and integrin α5-knockdown. The expression levels of integrin α5 and downstream genes were detected using western blotting. Stable icotinib-resistant (IcoR) cell lines (827/IcoR and PC9/IcoR) were established that showed enhanced malignant properties compared with parental cells (HCC827 and PC9). Furthermore, the resistant cell lines were resistant to icotinib in terms of proliferation, migration and invasion. The enrichment of function and signaling pathways analysis showed that integrin α5-upregulation was associated with the development of icotinib resistance. The knockdown of integrin α5 attenuated the migration and invasion capability of the resistant cells. Moreover, a combination of icotinib and integrin α5 siRNA significantly inhibited migration and partly restored icotinib sensitivity in IcoR cells. The expression levels of phosphorylated (p)-focal adhesion kinase (FAK), p-STAT3 and p-AKT decreased after knockdown of integrin α5, suggesting that FAK/STAT3/AKT signaling had a notable effect on the resistant cells. The present study revealed that the integrin α5/FAK/STAT3/AKT signaling pathway promoted icotinib resistance and malignancy in IcoR NSCLC cells.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the possibility of the ASFV (different isolates) survival in bodies of dead animals, bones, remnants of bone marrow, residual organ matrix in natural conditions.\nSkeletons of ASFV infected pigs which were died and left/abandoned in forests or buried in Armenia at diverse time points and locations had been excavated and examined for the presence of ASFV genome by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay and for infection abilities through in vitro (hemadsorption test and infection in porcine lung macrophages) as well as by intramuscular infection in healthy pigs.\nCurrent exploration showed that in several samples (with different times of exposure) of excavated skeletons had been detected the presence of the virus gene (p72) using real-time PCR. However, in none of these porcine samples, infectious ASFV could be isolated. Data obtained by real-time PCR at frequent intervals indicated the presence of the virus gene (p72), especially within the case of the acute form of the disease. This can be explained by the highest levels of the virus during the latter case mentioned above.\nASFV seems to be very sensitive to environmental temperature. The best place for ASFV long-term survival in the natural environment is bone marrow from intact big tubular bones (like femur or tibia) of buried carcasses. In artificial \"graves,\" complete bones with not destructed bone marrow can preserve the virus gene (p72) for a very long time (more than 2 years). Infectious particles in underground conditions survive not so long: In complete bones with not affected bone marrow, possible presence of the virus for several months.\nCopyright: © Arzumanyan, et al.\n", "authors": "Hranush Arzumanyan,Sona Hakobyan,Hranush Avagyan,Roza Izmailyan,Narek Nersisyan,Zaven Karalyan", "pmid": "34083931", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:53.900Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:53.900Z", "publish_date": "2021-04-09", "keywords": "African swine fever virus", "slug": "possibility-of-long-term-survival-of-african-swine", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 1582, "fields": {"title": "A Narrative Review of a Pulmonary Aerosolized Formulation or a Nasal Drop Using Sera Containing Neutralizing Antibodies Collected from COVID-19-Recovered Patients as a Probable Therapy for COVID-19.", "body": "\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged as a new contagion during December 2019, since which time it has triggered a rampant spike in fatality rates worldwide due to insufficient medical treatments and a lack of counteragents and prompted the World Health Organization to declare COVID-19 a public health emergency. It is, therefore, vital to accelerate the screening of new molecules or vaccines to win the battle against this pandemic. Experiences from previous epidemiological data on coronaviruses guide investigators in designing and exploring new compounds for a safe and cost-effective treatment. Several reports on the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic indicate that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the novel COVID-19 use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor for binding to the host cell in the lung epithelia through the spike protein on their virion surface. ACE2 is a mono-carboxypeptidase best known for cleaving major peptides and substrates. Its degree in human airway epithelia positively correlates with coronavirus infection. The treatment approach can be the neutralization of the virus entering lung epithelial cells by using sera containing antibodies collected from COVID-19-recovered patients. Hence, we herein propose a pulmonary aerosolized formulation or a nasal drop using sera, which contain antibodies to prevent, treat, or immunize against COVID-19 infection.\nCopyright: © Iranian Journal of Medical Sciences.\n", "authors": "Nishat Fatima,Vichitra Kaushik,Amjad Ayoub", "pmid": "34083848", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:53.902Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:53.902Z", "publish_date": null, "keywords": " Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2", "slug": "a-narrative-review-of-a-pulmonary-aerosolized-form", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 1583, "fields": {"title": "Inhibition of aberrant tissue remodelling by mesenchymal stromal cells singly coated with soft gels presenting defined chemomechanical cues.", "body": "\nThe precise understanding and control of microenvironmental cues could be used to optimize the efficacy of cell therapeutics.

An improved understanding of the mechanisms underpinning the outgrowth of Th22 cells will provide insights into their regulation during homeostasis, infection, and disease. To address this knowledge gap we generated 'IL-17A-fate-mapping IL-17A/IL-22 reporter transgenic mice' and show that Th22 cells develop in the gastrointestinal tract and lung during bacterial infection without transitioning via an Il17a-expressing intermediate, although in some compartments alternative transition pathways exist. Th22-cell development was not dependent on T-bet; however, this transcription factor functioned as a promiscuous T-cell-intrinsic regulator of IL-17A and IL-22 production, in addition to regulating the outgrowth, phenotypic stability, and plasticity of Th22 cells. Thus, we demonstrate that at sites of mucosal bacterial infection Th22 cells develop as a distinct lineage independently of Th17 cells; though both lineages exhibit bidirectional phenotypic flexibility within infected tissues and their draining lymph nodes, and that T-bet plays a critical regulatory role in Th22-cell function and identity.\n", "authors": "Jessica L Barnes,Maximilian W Plank,Kelly Asquith,Steven Maltby,Lorena R Sabino,Gerard E Kaiko,Alyssa Lochrin,Jay C Horvat,Jemma R Mayall,Richard Y Kim,Philip M Hansbro,Simon Keely,Gabrielle T Belz,Hock L Tay,Paul S Foster", "pmid": "34083747", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:53.907Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:53.907Z", "publish_date": "2021-06-03", "keywords": "", "slug": "t-helper-22-cells-develop-as-a-distinct-lineage-fr", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 1585, "fields": {"title": "High-resolution metabolomic biomarkers for lung cancer diagnosis and prognosis.", "body": "\nLung cancer is the leading cause of human cancer mortality due to the lack of early diagnosis technology.

In this study, plasma metabolic profiles of lung cancer were performed using a comprehensive metabolomic method with different liquid chromatography methods coupled with a Q-Exactive high-resolution mass spectrometer. Metabolites with different polarities (amino acids, fatty acids, and acylcarnitines) can be detected and identified as differential metabolites of lung cancer in small volumes of plasma.

Preoperative (neoadjuvant) therapies offer certain theoretical benefits compared with adjuvant approaches, including the ability to assess on-treatment response, reduce the tumor bulk prior to surgery, and enhance tolerability in the preoperative setting. Indeed, the use of neoadjuvant therapies are well established in other cancers such as breast and rectal cancers to debulk the tumor and guide ongoing therapy, and neoadjuvant chemotherapy has similar efficacy but less toxicity in NSCLC. More recently, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) targeting programmed death-1 (PD1)/PD1-ligand 1 (PD-L1) have transformed the treatment of advanced NSCLC; the unique mechanisms of action of ICI offer additional rationale for assessment in the neoadjuvant setting. Preclinical studies in mouse cancer models support the proof of concept of neoadjuvant ICI (NAICI) through improvement of T-cell effector function and long-term memory induction. Preliminary early-phase human trial data support the proposition that NAICI in NSCLC may provide an feasible and potentially efficacious future treatment strategy and large, randomized phase III trials are currently recruiting to assess this approach. However, outstanding issues include defining optimal treatment combinations which balance high efficacy with acceptable toxicity, validating biomarkers to aid in patient selection, and avoiding potential pitfalls such as missing a window for successful surgery, that is, choosing the right drugs, for the right patient, at the right time. Predictive biomarkers to direct selection of therapy are required, and the validation of major pathological response (MPR) as a surrogate for survival will be important in the uptake of the neoadjuvant approach.\n© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

However, the mechanisms underlying its anticancer activities are still not well understood. In this study, we evaluated the growth inhibitory effects of pemetrexed on PC9 (EGFR exon 19 deletion) cells and elucidated the underlying molecular mechanisms.\nPC9 cells were treated with pemetrexed and then assessed for the cell viability, morphological and nuclear changes, antigenic alterations, SA-β-gal staining, and changes in protein expression.\nPemetrexed reduced the cell viability of PC9 cells and initiated cell morphological changes in a concentration-dependent manner. Pemetrexed significantly induced G1 phase arrest in a dose-dependent manner. The results demonstrated that pemetrexed induced apoptosis in PC9 cells, a change coupled with an increase in reactive oxygen species and a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential. Pemetrexed decreased Bcl-2 expression, while Bax expression was increased, and cytochrome c was released. Furthermore, the expression of extrinsic pathway proteins, e.g. Fas/FasL, DR4/TRAIL, and Fas-associated protein with death domain, was increased by pemetrexed, which then activated caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3 and induced poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase proteolysis.\nThis study revealed the mechanisms by which pemetrexed works an anticancer drug in the treatment of NSCLC.\nCopyright © 2021 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

Cancer represents a further severe pathology which seems to be connected with the Holocaust experience. Our aim was to review the existing knowledge of Holocaust-related cancer in HS in order to assess its real incidence and clinicoprognostic significance.\nWe systematically reviewed the literature dealing with Israeli Jewish and non-Jewish non-Israeli HS developing cancer.

A statistically significant association between the Holocaust and development of late-onset cancer in HS was seen in most studies with cancer adversely impacting the survival. We also selected 330 noted Jewish non-Israeli HS: genocide-related late-onset cancer resulted to be a significant and independent risk factor of poor prognosis (p<0.0001) imparting shorter survival in affected versus non-cancer subjects (57 versus 64 years, respectively, p=0.0001).\nAlthough 76 years have passed, our review shows how the Holocaust keeps on burdening its survivors.

In addition, no prospective experiments provide direct evidence for transdifferentiation. In this study, we show that fibroblast growth factor 9 (FGF9) upregulation plays an essential role in transdifferentiation. An integrative omics analysis of paired tumor samples from a patient with transdifferentiated SCLC exhibited robust upregulation of FGF9. Furthermore, FGF9 upregulation was confirmed at the protein level in 4 out of 6 (66.7%) paired samples. FGF9 induction transformed mouse lung adenocarcinoma-derived cells to SCLC-like tumors in vivo through cell-autonomous activation of the FGFR pathway. In vivo, treatment of transdifferentiated SCLC-like tumors with the pan-FGFR inhibitor AZD4547 inhibited growth. In addition, FGF9 induced neuroendocrine differentiation, a pathological characteristic of SCLC, in established human lung adenocarcinoma cells.

The presence and relevance of DNA damage and genomic instability makes the micronucleus assay a suitable candidate to quantitatively estimate these early pathogenetic events. A systematic review and meta-analysis were planned to determine underlying common mechanisms that can explain the relationships between COPD and lung cancer. A total of 17 studies from Jan 1999 to Dec 2019 comparing micronucleus frequency in patients affected by respiratory diseases vs healthy controls were analysed. Our results confirmed the presence of significant association between MN frequency and the diseases investigated, and suggested a circle of events linking inflammation induced oxidative stress to the risk of disease through genomic instability and hypoxia. Therefore, using non-invasive, robust and cost effective genomic instability assays such as the micronucleus assay, would allow us to capture unique phenotypic and biological changes that would allow the identification of subjects at high risk of developing lung diseases and improve early detection strategies.\nCopyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The studies reviewed included microbial mutagenicity, DNA damage/ repair, cytogenetic effects, and gene mutations. In reviewing these studies, attention was paid to their conformance to applicable OECD test guidelines which are considered as internationally recognized standards for performing these assays. Cumene was not a bacterial mutagen and did not induce Hprt mutations in CHO cell cultures. In the primary rat hepatocyte cultures, cumene induced unscheduled DNA synthesis in one study but this response could not be reproduced in an independent study using a similar protocol. In a study that is not fully compliant to the current OECD guideline, no increase in chromosomal aberrations was observed in CHO cells treated with cumene. The weight of the evidence (WoE) from multiple in vivo studies indicates that cumene is not a clastogen or aneugen. The weak positive response in an in vivo comet assay in the rat liver and mouse lung tissues is of questionable significance due to several study deficiencies. The genotoxicity profile of cumene does not match that of a classic DNA-reactive molecule and the available data does not support a conclusion that cumene is an in vivo mutagen. As such, mutagenicity does not appear to be an early key event in cumene-induced rodent tumors and alternate hypothesized non-mutagenic modes-of-action are presented. Further data are necessary to rule in or rule out a particular MoA.\nCopyright © 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

Accurate characterisation of neurodevelopmental and psychological outcomes in children with CHD will drive improvements in patient and family outcomes through targeted intervention. Decades of research have produced a generalised perspective about neurodevelopmental and psychological outcomes in this heterogeneous population. Future investigations need to shift towards improving methods, measurement, and analyses of outcomes to better inform early identification, prevention, and intervention. Improved definition of underlying developmental, neuropsychological, and social-emotional constructs is needed, with an emphasis on symptom networks and dimensions. Identification of clinically meaningful outcomes that are most important to key stakeholders, including patients, families, schools and providers, is essential, specifically how and which neurodevelopmental differences across the developmental trajectory impact stakeholders. A better understanding of the discontinuity and patterns of neurodevelopment across the lifespan is critical as well, with some areas being more impactful at some ages than others.

Prior research, although limited, suggests that individualised developmental care interventions delivered early in life are beneficial for improving a range of outcomes including feeding, motor and cognitive development, and physiological regulation. Interventions to address self-regulatory, cognitive, and social-emotional challenges have shown promise in other medical populations, yet their applicability and effectiveness for use in individuals with CHD have not been examined. To move this field of research forward, we must strive to better understand the impact of neurodevelopmental and psychosocial intervention within the CHD population including adapting existing interventions for individuals with CHD. We must examine the ways in which dedicated cardiac neurodevelopmental follow-up programmes bolster resilience and support children and families through the myriad transitions inherent to the experience of living with CHD.

Recognition of the need to proactively support parent mental health and family functioning following cardiac diagnosis to promote psychosocial adaptation has increased substantially over recent years. However, significant gaps in knowledge remain and families continue to report critical unmet psychosocial needs. The Parent Mental Health and Family Functioning Working Group of the Cardiac Neurodevelopmental Outcome Collaborative was formed in 2018 through support from an R13 grant from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to identify significant knowledge gaps related to parent mental health and family functioning, as well as critical questions that must be answered to further knowledge, policy, care, and outcomes. Conceptually driven investigations are needed to identify parent mental health and family functioning factors with the strongest influence on child outcomes, to obtain a deeper understanding of the biomarkers associated with these factors, and to better understand how parent mental health and family functioning influence child outcomes over time. Investigations are also needed to develop, test, and implement sustainable models of mental health screening and assessment, as well as effective interventions to optimise parent mental health and family functioning to promote psychosocial adaptation.

The number of unmatched regions might reflect ARDS severity and affect the risk of ventilation-induced lung injury. Despite pathophysiological relevance, unmatched ventilation and perfusion are not routinely assessed at the bedside. The aims of this study were to quantify unmatched ventilation and perfusion at the bedside by electrical impedance tomography (EIT) investigating their association with mortality in patients with ARDS and to explore the effects of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) on unmatched ventilation and perfusion in subgroups of patients with different ARDS severity based on PaO2/FiO2 and compliance.\nProspective observational study in 50 patients with mild (36%), moderate (46%), and severe (18%) ARDS under clinical ventilation settings. EIT was applied to measure the regional distribution of ventilation and perfusion using central venous bolus of saline 5% during end-inspiratory pause. We defined unmatched units as the percentage of only ventilated units plus the percentage of only perfused units.\nPercentage of unmatched units was significantly higher in non-survivors compared to survivors (32[27-47]% vs. 21[17-27]%, p < 0.001). Percentage of unmatched units was an independent predictor of mortality (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.07-1.39, p = 0.004) with an area under the ROC curve of 0.88 (95% CI 0.79-0.97, p < 0.001).

Reductions in MDHeart achievable without breaching limits on target coverage or normal tissue irradiation were determined. The process was repeated for objectives limiting the heart volume receiving ≥ 50 Gy (VHeart-50-Gy) and left atrial wall volume receiving ≥ 63 Gy (VLAwall-63-Gy).\nFollowing re-optimization, mean MDHeart, VHeart-50-Gy and VLAwall-63-Gy values fell by 4.8 Gy and 2.2% and 2.4% absolute respectively. On the basis of associations observed between survival and cardiac irradiation in an independent dataset, the purposefully-achieved reduction in MDHeart is expected to lead to the largest improvement in overall survival. It also led to useful knock-on reductions in many measures of cardiac irradiation including VHeart-50-Gy and VLAwall-63-Gy, providing some insurance against survival being more strongly related to these measures than to MDHeart. The predicted hazard ratio (HR) for death corresponding to the purposefully-achieved mean reduction in MDHeart was 0.806, according to which a randomized trial would require 1140 patients to test improved survival with 0.05 significance and 80% power. In patients whose baseline MDHeart values exceeded the median value in a published series, the average MDHeart reduction was particularly large, 8.8 Gy. The corresponding predicted HR is potentially testable in trials recruiting 359 patients enriched for greater MDHeart values.\nCardiac irradiation in RT of LA-NSCLC can be reduced substantially. Of the measures studied, reduction of MDHeart led to the greatest predicted increase in survival, and to useful knock-on reductions in other cardiac irradiation measures reported to be associated with survival. Potential improvements in survival can be trialled more efficiently in a population enriched for patients with greater baseline MDHeart levels, for whom larger reductions in heart doses can be achieved.\n", "authors": "Louise Turtle,Neeraj Bhalla,Andrew Willett,Robert Biggar,Jonathan Leadbetter,Georgios Georgiou,James M Wilson,Sindu Vivekanandan,Maria A Hawkins,Michael Brada,John D Fenwick", "pmid": "34082782", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:54.048Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:54.049Z", "publish_date": "2021-06-03", "keywords": "Cardiac-sparing", "slug": "cardiac-sparing-radiotherapy-for-locally-advanced-", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 1631, "fields": {"title": "Assessing field performance of ultrasensitive rapid diagnostic tests for malaria: a systematic review and meta-analysis.", "body": "\nTo overcome the limitations of conventional malaria rapid diagnostic tests (cRDTs) in diagnosing malaria in patients with low parasitaemia, ultrasensitive malaria rapid diagnostic tests (uRDTs) have recently been developed, with promising results under laboratory conditions.

Research studies on cadavers have shown that direct heart and kidney injury can be frequently seen in patients deceased due to COVID-19 infection. On the other hand, functional or structural dysfunction of the heart may deteriorate the renal function and vice versa. This concept is already known as the cardiorenal syndrome and may play a role in COVID-19.

Regrettably, no therapy currently can effectively reverse the silica-induced fibrotic lesion. Emerging evidence has indicated that the dysregulation of microRNAs is involved in silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis. The aim of this study is to explore the expression pattern and underlying mechanisms of miR-770-5p in silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Consistent with our previous miRNA microarray analysis, the results of qRT-PCR showed that miR-770-5p expression was downregulated in silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis in humans and animal models. Administration of miR-770-5p agomir significantly reduced the fibrotic lesions in the lungs of mice exposed to silica dust. MiR-770-5p also exhibited a dramatic reduction in TGF-β1-activated human pulmonary fibroblasts (MRC-5). Transfection of miR-770-5p mimics significantly decreased the viability, migration ability, and S/G0 phase distribution, as well as the expression of fibronectin, collagen I, and α-SMA in TGF-β1-treated MRC-5 cells. Transforming growth factor-β receptor 1 (TGFBR1) was confirmed as a direct target of regulation by miR-770-5p. The expression of TGFBR1 was significantly increased in pulmonary fibrosis. Knockdown of TGFBR1 blocked the transduction of the TGF-β1 signaling pathway and attenuated the activation of MRC-5 cells, while overexpression of TGFBR1 effectively restored the activation of MRC-5 cells inhibited by miR-770-5p. Together, our results demonstrated that miR-770-5p exerted an anti-fibrotic effect in silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis by targeting TGFBR1. Targeting miR-770-5p might provide a new therapeutic strategy to prevent the abnormal activation of pulmonary fibroblasts in silicosis.\nCopyright © 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Nevertheless, the function of circRNAs in cadmium carcinogenesis is unclear. circ-SHPRH is down-regulated in many cancers including non-small cell lung cancer. In our present study, during cadmium-induced transformation of human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was induced. Meanwhile, at the middle and late stages of cell transformation, cadmium down-regulated the expression of circ-SHPRH, as well as QKI, a tumor suppressor protein known to prevent the proliferation and EMT during progression of human cancers, compared with passage-matched control BEAS-2B cells. Overexpression of circ-SHPRH in cadmium-transformed BEAS-2B cells promoted the expression of QKI and significantly inhibited proliferation, EMT, invasion, migration and anchorage-independent growth in soft agar of the cells. Mechanistic studies showed that circ-SHPRH functioned as a sponge of miR-224-5p to regulate QKI expression. Interestingly, QKI and circ-SHPRH could form a positive-feedback loop that perpetuated circ-SHPRH/miR-224-5p/QKI axis. Collectively, our results demonstrated that circ-SHPRH inhibited cadmium-induced transformation of BEAS-2B cells through sponging miR-224-5p to regulate QKI expression under cadmium treatment.

Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is an important receptor mediating the toxic effects of many environmental compounds, and is also involved in regulating tumor cell migration. Glioblastoma is the most malignant glioma and exhibits high motility, but the effects of AhR on the migration of glioblastoma are still unclear. We aimed to understand the role of AhR in the migration of this type of tumor cell and to explore the underlying molecular mechanism. In cultured human neuroblastoma cells (U87), we found that AhR overexpression or knockdown increased or suppressed the migration ability of U87 cells, respectively. Furthermore, inhibition of basal activation of the AhR pathway suppressed migration ability, suggesting a positive correlation between endogenous activity of the AhR pathway and cell migration. When the AhR pathway was activated by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) or 6-formyl [3,2-b] carbazole (FICZ), the migration of U87 cells was inhibited by inducing the expression of a tumor suppressor, IL24, which is a downstream responsive gene of AhR activation. Moreover, a similar AhR-IL24-dependent mechanism for migration inhibition of TCDD was documented in a breast cancer cell line and a lung cancer cell line. This study demonstrated that AhR plays important roles in regulating the migration of glioblastoma, and the induction of the AhR-IL24 axis mediates the inhibition of migration in response to TCDD or FICZ treatment.\nCopyright © 2021.

DBP as an immune adjuvant is related to the development of multiple allergic diseases. However, the current research involving DBP-induced pulmonary toxicity remains poorly understood. Therefore, this research aimed to explore the adverse effect and potential mechanism of DBP exposure on the lungs in rats. In our study, ovalbumin was used to build a rat model of allergic airway inflammation to study any harmful effect of DBP exposure on lung tissues. Rats were treated by intragastric administration of DBP (500 mg kg-1 or 750 mg kg-1) and/or subcutaneous injection of SFN (4 mg kg-1). The results of histopathological analysis, cell count, and myeloperoxidase showed that DBP promoted the inflammatory damage of lungs. In the lung tissues, the detection of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUNT nick end labeling and oxidative stress indices showed that DBP significantly increased the level of apoptosis and oxidative stress. Western blot analysis indicated that DBP raised the expression level of thymic stromal lymphopoietin and reduced the nuclear expression level of nuclear factor-erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), which was further verified by quantitative real-time PCR. Meanwhile, DBP treatment markedly up-regulated the inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-13, and rat mast cell protease-2, a marker secreted by mast cells (MCs). Conversely, sulforaphane, a Nrf2 inducer, ameliorated the pulmonary damage induced by DBP in the above. Altogether, our data provides a new insight into the impacts of the activation of MCs on the DBP-induced pulmonary toxicity as well as the safety evaluation of DBP.\nCopyright © 2021.

Our previous studies demonstrated that 17β-estradiol (E2) promoted lung adenocarcinoma cell proliferation and tumor growth through estrogen receptor ERα. Transcriptomic analysis suggested that E2 potentiated TNFα-NFκB signaling in ERα-expressing lung adenocarcinoma cells. This study further demonstrated that E2 increased TNFα receptor expression and TNFα-triggered NFκB activity in ERα-expressing cells. E2-activated ERα had no pHysical association with NFκB p65/p50 heterodimer but facilitated TNFα-initiated IκBα degradation, NFκB nuclear translocation, and S468/S536 phosphorylation of p65 essential for NFκB activity. While knockdown of ERα prevented E2 from boosting NFκB activity, antiestrogen ICI 182,780 stimulated NFκB activity like E2. Inhibition of GSK3β hampered E2:ERα-promoted NFκB activity and abolished S468 phosphorylation of p65, suggesting that GSK3β played a role in the E2-TNFα signaling crosstalk. In ERα-expressing cells, E2 and TNFα synergistically regulated many genes that were not typically responsive to either E2 or TNFα. Functional analysis of microarray data inferred that E2/TNFα-induced transcriptomic changes improved cell survival and movement. Viability and colony formation assays validated that E2 and TNFα together increased cisplatin tolerance of ERα-expressing cells. Wound healing assays also confirmed that E2/TNFα cotreatment increased cell migration in an ERα-dependent manner. E2/TNFα-induced dysregulation of genes such as cell survival and movement-associated genes, proto-oncogenes, metallothioneins and histone core genes was correlated with poor overall survival in patients. In summary, E2 and TNFα engaged in an ERα-dependent positive crosstalk in lung adenocarcinoma cells, consequently increasing NFκB activation, cisplatin tolerance and cell migration and worsening prognosis.\nCopyright © 2021.

Three batches of ALIS spanning a range of lipid concentrations (43, 48 and 54 mg/mL) were tested with nine PARI inhalation devices that varied within the production process of the vibrating membrane with respect to hole geometry. Three clusters were built including a geometry close to the mean geometry (median) and two geometries deviating from the mean geometry with smaller (smaller) and larger (larger) holes. The output parameters included the nebulization rate, the aerosol droplet size distribution, the liposome vesicle size post-nebulization, and the fraction of amikacin that remained encapsulated post-nebulization. Across the 27 experimental combinations of three formulation batches and nine devices, the nebulization time varied between 12 and 15 minutes with the fastest nebulization rate occurring with the combination of low lipid concentration and larger hole geometry (0.68 gram/min) and the slowest nebulization rate occurring with the combination of high lipid concentration and the smaller hole geometry (0.59 gram/min). The mean liposome vesicle size post-nebulization ranged from 269-296 nm across all experimental combinations which was unchanged from the control samples (276-292 nm). While all three batches contained >99% encapsulated amikacin prior to nebulization, the nebulization process resulted in a consistent generation of ∼35% unencapsulated amikacin (range: 33.8% to 37.6%). There was no statistically significant difference in the generated aerosol particle size distributions. The mass median aerodynamic diameters (MMAD) ranged from 4.78 µm to 4.98 µm, the geometric standard deviations (GSD) ranged from 1.61 to 1.66, and the aerosol fine particle fraction (FPF< 5 µm) ranged from 50.3 to 53.5%. The emitted dose (ED) of amikacin ranged from 473 to 523 mg (80.2 to 89.3% of loaded dose (LD)) and the fine particle dose (FPD< 5 µm) ranged from 244 to 278 mg (41.4 to 47.1% of label claim (LC)). In conclusion, while variations in the lipid concentration of the ALIS formulation and the device hole geometry had a small but significant impact on nebulization time, the critical aerosol performance parameters were maintained and remained within acceptable limits.\nCopyright © 2021.

AZIN2 overexpression promoted cell viability, colony formation, and reduced cell apoptosis in H1299 cells and A549 upon DDP treatment. Correspondingly, AZIN2 knockdown significantly inhibited cell viability and colony formation, and increased cell apoptosis upon DDP treatment. Interestingly, AZIN2 expression in NSCLC cells was significantly induced by hypoxia condition. The occupancy of HIF-1α, an important regulator of the hypoxia response, remarkably enriched at the promoter region of AZIN2 under hypoxia condition.

However, the potential therapeutic use of cannabis and cannabinoids for the treatment of respiratory diseases has not been widely investigated, in part because of local irritation of airways by needing to smoke the cannabis, poor bioavailability when administered orally due to the lipophilic nature of cannabinoids, and the psychoactive effects of Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) found in cannabis. The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of two of the non-psychotropic cannabinoids, cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabigerol (CBG) alone and in combination, in a model of pulmonary inflammation induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The second purpose was to explore the effects of two different cannabinoid formulations administered orally (PO) and intraperitoneally (IP). Medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil was used as the sole solvent for one formulation, whereas the second formulation consisted of a Cremophor® EL (polyoxyl 35 castor oil, CrEL)-based micellar solution.\nExposure of guinea pigs to LPS induced a 97 ± 7 % and 98 ± 3% increase in neutrophils found in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) at 4 hours and 24 hours, respectively. Administration of CBD and CBG formulated with MCT oil did not show any significant effects on the LPS-induced neutrophilia measured in the BAL fluid when compared with the vehicle-treated groups. Conversely, the administration of either cannabinoid formulated with CrEL induced a significant attenuation of the LPS induced recruitment of neutrophils into the lung following both intraperitoneal (IP) and oral (PO) administration routes, with a 55 - 65% and 50 - 55% decrease in neutrophil cell recruitment with the highest doses of CBD and CBG respectively. A combination of CBD and CBG (CBD:CBG = 1:1) formulated in CrEL and administered orally was also tested to determine possible interactions between the cannabinoids. However, a mixture of CBD and CBG did not show a significant change in LPS-induced neutrophilia. Surfactants, such as CrEL, improves the dissolution of lipophilic drugs in an aqueous medium by forming micelles and entrapping the drug molecules within them, consequently increasing the drug dissolution rate. Additionally, surfactants increase permeability and absorption by disrupting the structural organisation of the cellular lipid bilayer.\nIn conclusion, this study has provided evidence that CBD and CBG formulated appropriately exhibit anti-inflammatory activity. Our observations suggest that these non-psychoactive cannabinoids may have beneficial effects in treating diseases characterised by airway inflammation.\nCopyright © 2021.

It is shown that the essential nutrients zinc, ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), vitamin D and magnesium provide the ideal combination for prevention and treatment of COVID-19: prevention of SARS-CoV-2 entry to host cells, prevention of proliferation of SARS-CoV-2, inhibition of excessive inflammation, improved control of the regulation of the immune system, inhibition of the cytokine storm, and reduction in the effects of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and associated non-communicable diseases. It is emphasized that the non-communicable diseases associated with COVID-19 are inherently more prevalent in the elderly than the young, and that the maintenance of sufficiency of zinc, ω-3 PUFAs, vitamin D and magnesium is essential for the elderly to prevent the occurrence of non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, lung diseases and cancer. Annual checking of levels of these essential nutrients is recommended for those over 65 years of age, together with appropriate adjustments in their intake, with these services and supplies being at government cost.

Abnormal expression of histone deacetylases (HDACs) is often reported in various types of cancers. Few pan HDAC inhibitors have been approved for use as therapeutic interventions for cancer treatment including vorinostat, belinostat and panobinostat. However, not all the HDAC isoforms are abnormally expressed in certain cancers, such as in the case of, ovarian cancer where overexpression of HDAC1-3, lung cancer where overexpression of HDAC 1 and 3 and gastric cancer where overexpression of HDAC2 is seen. Therefore, pan-inhibition of HDAC is not an efficient way to combat cancer via HDAC inhibition. Hence, isoform-selective HDAC inhibition can be one of the best therapeutic strategies in the treatment of cancer. In this context since aberrant expression of HDAC2 largely contributes to cancer progression by silencing pro-apoptotic protein expressions such as NOXA and APAF1 (caspase 9-activating proteins) and inactivation of tumor suppressor p53, HDAC2 specific inhibitors may help to develop not only the direct targets but also indirect targets that are crucial for tumor development. However, to develop a HDAC2 specific and potent inhibitor, extensive knowledge of its structure and specific functions is essential. The present review updates details on the structural features, physiological functions, and roles of HDAC2 in different types of cancer, emphasizing the challenges and status of the development of HDAC2 selective inhibitors against various types of cancer.\nCopyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

EVA markedly improved the bioavailability, which might be ascribed to the serum albumin deposit effect. EVA was bound to albumin in the same hydrophobic pocket as EVO, but one more hydrogen bond was formed between Asp323 and the amino group at the C10 position. The amino derivative of natural alkaloids showed a substantial increase in antitumor activity on small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cells. The role of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in alkaloid/derivative-induced apoptosis in tumor cells was thoroughly described. p-AKT, its downstream effectors Bcl-2, Bax, caspase-3 and its upstream regulator PTEN were regulated by EVA. The interaction between EVO/EVA and the upstream protein PI3K p110 was first investigated with molecular docking. The apoptosis induced by EVA was abrogated after the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was reactivated by IGF-1. The interaction between EVO/EVA and P-gp was also first studied using docking method. Their binding forces were weak. But EVA might reduce much expression of P-gp than EVO, and ultimately led to reduction of EVA efflux.

By high-throughput sequencing, circSPAG16 was identified to be the most significantly downregulated circRNA in cadmium-transformed cells. CircSPAG16 was downregulated at Week 8, 12, 16, and 20 during cadmium-induced cell transformation. In addition, circSPAG16 overexpression prevented cadmium-induced transformation of BEAS-2B cells.

Cytogenetic tests were conducted on 1240 healthy medical workers and cancer incidence was followed up between 1997-2018. Both structural and numerical chromosome aberrations were evaluated and the results were compared taking into account gender, age, and smoking. The frequency of aberrant cells was significantly higher in smoker males than in non-smokers (p=0.009). Within the same study period, there was no significant difference in chromosome aberrations between the potentially exposed group of workers and the control group. Among 82 cancer cases (6.6%) the most common tumors were breast (16), colon (12), lung (7) and thyroid gland cancers (7). Our analysis showed 7.3% cancer occurrence among smokers compared to 6.2% among non-smokers. These results suggest that in our cases cytogenetic effects of smoking are more deleterious than occupational exposures.\n", "authors": "Gyöngyi Farkas,Zsuzsa S Kocsis,Gábor Székely,Mária Dobozi,Csaba Polgár,Zsolt Jurányi", "pmid": "34081761", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:54.181Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:54.181Z", "publish_date": "2021-04-05", "keywords": "", "slug": "and-what-about-doctors-associations-between-sponta", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 1664, "fields": {"title": "[Predictive relevance of KRAS mutational status in bone metastatic lung adenocarcinoma treated with bisphosphonate therapy].", "body": "\nThe therapeutic impact of KRAS mutations remains controversial in bone metastatic lung adenocarcinoma (LADC).

The overall incidence of cancer in Sri Lanka has doubled over the past 25 years with a parallel rise in cancer-related mortality. Cancer has become the second commonest cause of hospital mortality in Sri Lanka. In this review, we aim to provide an overview of the current status and future direction of cancer care in Sri Lanka.\nIn Sri Lanka, cancer services are predominantly provided by the state sector free of charge to the general public. With the establishment of national cancer policy on cancer prevention and control, there has been a commendable improvement in the cancer services provided island-wide. An increasing number of breast, oropharyngeal, thyroid, oesophageal, colorectal, lung, and gastric cancers are being diagnosed and treated annually. Primary prevention measures include restrictions in tobacco and HPV vaccination. Screening programs for selected cancers such as breast, oral and cervical cancers are delivered. Medical oncology units with facilities for systemic therapy and adequately supported by surgical, pathology, and radiology departments have been established in each district general hospital island-wide. Although the current progress is commendable, future changes are necessary to overcome the current limitations and to cater the ever increasing burden of cancer. Measures are necessary to enhance the coverage of Sri Lanka Cancer Registry. Timely high-quality research and audits are essential. Community participation in planning strategies for cancer prevention and treatment is minimal. Community-based palliative care facilities and radiation and other systemic therapy should be made available in all provinces. A culture of multi-disciplinary care with proper referral pathways would help to improve the current setting.\nIn conclusion, Sri Lanka has a reasonably balanced and continuously expanding program for prevention, screening, and treatment of cancers. Emphasis on preventive strategies related to reducing tobacco smoking, chewing betel, and obesity, making cancers a notifiable disease, involving the community in planning cancer care and prevention strategies, conducting research to evaluate cost-effectiveness of existing treatment and increasing radiotherapy facilities would further improve the cancer services in Sri Lanka.\n", "authors": "Umesh Jayarajah,Anuruddha M Abeygunasekera", "pmid": "34081229", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:54.198Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:54.198Z", "publish_date": "2021-06-03", "keywords": "Cancer", "slug": "cancer-services-in-sri-lanka-current-status-and-fu", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 1668, "fields": {"title": "Prognostic Significance of Echocardiographic Measures of Cardiac Remodeling in the Community.", "body": "\nEchocardiography is a noninvasive tool of choice for evaluating cardiac structure and function in numerous cardiac conditions ranging from congenital heart disease, myocardial diseases, coronary artery disease (CAD), valvulopathies, arrhythmias, and pericardial disorders.

Here, we describe 23 cases of a previously unrecognized entity, provisionally termed \"pseudoendocrine sarcoma.\" Pseudoendocrine sarcoma is a rare, distinctive tumor of uncertain lineage with a predilection for paravertebral soft tissue in older adults. Fifteen patients (65%) were male and 8 were female. Age at presentation ranged from 29 to 78 years (median: 62 y). Nineteen tumors (83%) occurred in truncal locations, including 15 tumors (65%) in paravertebral soft tissue; other locations included the posterior head (2 tumors), thigh (1), and orbit (1). Tumor size ranged from 2 to 19 cm (median: 6.35 cm). Pseudoendocrine sarcoma is composed of sheets, trabeculae, and nests of epithelioid or ovoid cells with indistinct borders, palely eosinophilic cytoplasm, and highly monomorphic, round nuclei with speckled chromatin. Pseudoglandular architecture was at least focally present in 16 tumors (70%), large extracellular hyaline globules were identified in 12 tumors (52%), and psammomatous calcifications were present in 8 (35%). Metaplastic ossification was identified in 2 tumors, and myxoid stroma was present in 1. Lymphovascular invasion was present in 5 of 18 tumors (28%). Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that most tumors showed nuclear positivity for β-catenin (20/21 tumors; 95%), and some showed at least focal positivity for S-100 (9/22; 41%), desmin (3/8; 38%), or CD34 (2/8; 25%). All tumors were negative for neuroendocrine and epithelial markers, including synaptophysin (21 tumors), chromogranin (19), INSM1 (4), pan-K (16), CAM5.2 (13), AE1/AE3 (6), epithelial membrane antigen (20), and E-cadherin (13). DNA sequencing detected CTNNB1 point mutations in all 6 sequenced tumors: D32H, S33C, S33F, S37A, S37C, and S37F. RNA sequencing was negative for gene fusions in all 6 sequenced tumors.

Six of 14 patients with long-term follow-up experienced local recurrence (43%, at intervals of 3 to 6 y). One tumor showed a local lymph node metastasis within the primary excision specimen, and 3 patients developed distant lung metastases (21%). No patient died of the disease as yet. Despite its bland morphology and resemblance to the well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor, pseudoendocrine sarcoma is best considered an intermediate-grade sarcoma, given its pathologic characteristics and clinical behavior.\nCopyright © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Six weeks after initiation of CS or air exposure, sham surgery or denervation of the agonists of the left plantaris muscle was performed. The right leg served as internal control. Twelve weeks later, the hypertrophic response was assessed. CS exposure instigated loss of body and muscle mass, and increased lung inflammatory cell infiltration (p<0.05), independently of diet. Maximal exercise capacity, whole body strength, in situ plantaris muscle force and key markers of hypertrophic signaling (Akt, 4EBP1, FoxO1) were not significantly affected by smoking or diet.

One potential mechanism identified to date is the synergism between estrogen and some tobacco compounds, and oncogene mutations, in inducing the expression of metabolic enzymes, leading to enhanced formation of reactive oxygen species and DNA adducts, and subsequent lung carcinogenesis. In this review, we present the literature available regarding sex differences in cancer rates, associations of male and female sex hormones with lung cancer, the influence of exogenous hormone therapy in women, and potential mechanisms mediated by male and female sex hormone receptors in lung carcinogenesis. The influence of biological sex on lung disease has recently been established, thus new research incorporating this variable will shed light on the mechanisms behind the observed disparities in lung cancer rates, and potentially lead to the development of new therapeutics to treat this devastating disease.\n", "authors": "Nathalie Fuentes,Miguel Silva Rodriguez,Patricia Silveyra", "pmid": "34080912", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:54.230Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:54.230Z", "publish_date": "2021-06-03", "keywords": "Lung", "slug": "role-of-sex-hormones-in-lung-cancer", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 1677, "fields": {"title": "Single-Stage Transthoracic Surgery of Right Pulmonary and Hepatic Hydatid Cysts: A Retrospective Study of Fourteen Patients.", "body": "\n\nBackground:\n The association of pulmonary and hepatic hydatid cysts is rare. Managing this condition with low mortality and complications is a challenge. The aim of this study is to put forward our experience in managing both sites in single-stage posterolateral thoracotomy. \nPatients and Methods:\n A retrospective study of 14 patients who underwent single-stage posterolateral thoracotomy and phrenotomy to treat right lung and liver hydatid cysts between January 2010 and December 2019 were reviewed. \nResults:\n Fourteen of 135 patients (10.4%) with double location of hydatid disease were treated in our department for pulmonary hydatid cysts in the same period. There were nine males and five females who were 20 to 72 years old (average age, 42.7 years). Chest computed tomography (CT) and abdominal scan were performed in all cases. The surgical approach was posterolateral thoracotomy and phrenotomy without laparotomy in all cases. Conservation of hepatic and pulmonary parenchymas was possible in 13 patients (92.8%). Average operative time was 122 minutes (range, 95-210 minutes) and the average post-operative hospital stay was 8.7 days. Post-operative complications occurred in two (14.3%) cases, one was atelectasis and the other persistent biliary and air leakage. There was no post-operative mortality. All patients received post-operative medical treatment for three to six months and there was no recurrence after an average follow-up of 26 months. \nConclusion:\n Single-stage thoracotomy is a better option than thoracotomy and laparotomy for the management of double located hydatid cysts. It has a lower complication rate, shorter hospital stay, and rapid resumption of normal activity.\n", "authors": "El Hassane Kabiri,Massime El Hammoumi,Mohammed Bhairis,Faycal El Oueriachi,Moaad Amraoui", "pmid": "34080885", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:54.234Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:54.234Z", "publish_date": "2021-06-02", "keywords": "hydatid cysts", "slug": "single-stage-transthoracic-surgery-of-right-pulmon", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 1678, "fields": {"title": "Discovery of AZD8154, a Dual PI3Kγδ Inhibitor for the Treatment of Asthma.", "body": "\nStarting from our previously described PI3Kγ inhibitors, we describe the exploration of structure-activity relationships that led to the discovery of highly potent dual PI3Kγδ inhibitors.

Although spirometric lung age (SLA) is regarded as an effective way to augment the smoking quit rate in other countries, it has not been calculated in Chinese smokers. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the association of SLA with smoking status, and further explore whether smoking duration, dependence and other factors such as obesity and physical exercise affect SLA in Chinese current smokers. A total of 431 healthy men aged 20 years and older took part in the study from September 2018 to August 2019. Spirometric test was measured through a portable spirometry, and smoking status including smoking duration and dependence was investigated by using a questionnaire. SLA was calculated from an established equation which is based on the inverse calculation of the forced expiratory volume in one second in the Chinese population. Lung age difference (∆LA) could be obtained by counting the difference between SLA and chronological age. Results indicated that ∆LA is remarkably higher in current smokers than that in ex-smokers and non-smokers (p < 0.01). The study also revealed that smoking duration and dependence are related to ∆LA. Smokers with long smoking duration (smoked ≥10 years) and high dependence (consumed ≥20 cigarettes per day) had a significantly higher ∆LA than their counterparties (p < 0.01). Multiple regression analysis showed that body mass index, smoking duration and cigarettes per day were independently correlated with ∆LA in the current smokers (p < 0.01).

Therefore, the resistance of certain cancer cells to TRAIL is a major concern and agents that can either enhance TRAIL capabilities or overcome TRAIL resistance are necessary for the development of cancer treatments. The present study investigated whether the antidepressant drug amitriptyline could sensitize TRAIL‑resistant A549 lung cancer cells and enhance TRAIL‑induced apoptosis. Antidepressants are usually prescribed to cancer patients to relieve emotional distress, such as depression or dysthymia. The present study revealed for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that amitriptyline increased death receptor (DR) 4 and 5 expression, a requirement for TRAIL‑induced cell death. Genetic inhibitors of DR4 and DR5 significantly reduced amitriptyline‑enhanced TRAIL‑mediated apoptosis. Additionally, the present study explored whether blocking autophagy increased DR4 and DR5 expression. Blocking autophagy flux with the final stage autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) also upregulated DR4 and DR5 expression. TRAIL in combination with amitriptyline or CQ significantly increased the expression of apoptosis‑indicator proteins cleaved caspase‑8 and caspase‑3. The expression levels of LC3‑II and p62 were significantly higher in amitriptyline‑treated cells, which confirmed that amitriptyline blocks autophagy by inhibiting the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes.

Autophagy activation serves a crucial role in MDR. However, the specific molecular mechanism linking autophagy with MDR remains unknown. The results of the present study demonstrated that autophagy was inhibited and microRNA (miR)‑199a‑5p levels were upregulated in MDR model lung cancer cells (A549/T and H1299/T) compared with those in the parental cell lines. Paclitaxel (PTX) treatment increased the expression levels of miR‑199a‑5p in parental lung cancer cells compared with those in PTX‑untreated cells, and these expression levels were negatively correlated with PTX sensitivity of the cells. miR‑199a‑5p knockdown in A549/T cells induced autophagy and resensitized cells to multiple chemotherapeutic drugs including PTX, taxotere, topotecan, SN38, oxaliplatin and vinorelbine. By contrast, miR‑199a‑5p overexpression in A549 cells suppressed autophagy and desensitized cells to these chemotherapeutic drugs. Mechanistically, the results of the present study demonstrated that miR‑199a‑5p blocked autophagy by activating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and inhibiting the protein expression of autophagy‑related 5. Furthermore, p62 protein was identified as a direct target of miR‑199a‑5p; miR‑199a‑5p bound to p62 mRNA to decrease its mRNA and protein expression levels. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggested that miR‑199a‑5p may contribute to MDR development in lung cancer cells by inhibiting autophagy and targeting p62. The regulatory effect of miR‑199a‑5p on autophagy may provide novel insights for future multidrug‑resistant lung cancer chemotherapy.\n", "authors": "Tianjiao Zeng,Mingshi Xu,Wanli Zhang,Xiaofan Gu,Fangqing Zhao,Xuan Liu,Xiongwen Zhang", "pmid": "34080652", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:54.266Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:54.266Z", "publish_date": "2021-06-03", "keywords": "autophagy", "slug": "autophagy-inhibition-and-microrna199a5p-upregulati", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 1684, "fields": {"title": "MicroRNA‑129 plays a protective role in sepsis‑induced acute lung injury through the suppression of pulmonary inflammation via the modulation of the TAK1/NF‑κB pathway.", "body": "\nExcessive inflammatory response and apoptosis play key roles in the pathogenic mechanisms of sepsis‑induced acute lung injury (ALI); however, the molecular pathways linked to ALI pathogenesis remain unclear. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) have emerged as important regulators of inflammation and apoptosis in sepsis‑induced ALI; however, the exact regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs remain poorly understood. In the present study, the gene microarray dataset GSE133733 obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database was analyzed and a total of 38 differentially regulated miRNAs were identified, including 17 upregulated miRNAs and 21 downregulated miRNAs, in mice with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)‑induced ALI, in comparison to the normal control mice. miR‑129 was found to be the most significant miRNA, among the identified miRNAs. The upregulation of miR‑129 markedly alleviated LPS‑induced lung injury, as indicated by the decrease in lung permeability in and the wet‑to‑dry lung weight ratio, as well as the improved survival rate of mice with ALI administered miR‑129 mimic. Moreover, the upregulation of miR‑129 reduced pulmonary inflammation and apoptosis in mice with ALI. Of note, transforming growth factor activated kinase‑1 (TAK1), a well‑known regulator of the nuclear factor‑κB (NF‑κB) pathway, was directly targeted by miR‑129 in RAW 264.7 cells. More importantly, miR‑129 upregulation impeded the LPS‑induced activation of the TAK1/NF‑κB signaling pathway, as illustrated by the suppression of the nuclear phosphorylated‑p65, p‑IκB‑α and p‑IKKβ expression levels. Collectively, the findings of the present study indicate that miR‑129 protects mice against sepsis‑induced ALI by suppressing pulmonary inﬂammation and apoptosis through the regulation of the TAK1/NF‑κB signaling pathway.

BA significantly inhibited the proliferation and migration of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) through targeting Skp2-SCF E3 ligase both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, BA binding to Skp2, especially forming H-bond with residue Lys145, decreases its stability by disrupting Skp1-Skp2 interactions, thereby inhibiting the Skp2-SCF E3 ligase and promoting the accumulation of its substrates, that is, E-cadherin and p27. In both subcutaneous and orthotopic xenografts, BA significantly inhibited the proliferation and metastasis of NSCLC through targeting Skp2-SCF E3 ligase and upregulating p27 and E-cadherin protein levels. Taken together, BA can be considered a valuable therapeutic candidate to inhibit metastasis of NSCLC.\nThis article is protected by copyright.

Low-field MRI systems equipped with contemporary hardware can provide high-quality structural lung imaging by virtue of the prolonged T2 *. Fortuitously, the T1 relaxivity of oxygen increases at lower field strengths, which is expected to improve the sensitivity of oxygen-enhanced lung MRI. We implemented a breath-held T1 -weighted 3D stack-of-spirals UTE acquisition with a 7 ms spiral-out readout. Measurement repeatability was assessed using five repetitions of oxygen-enhanced lung imaging in healthy volunteers (n = 7). The signal intensity at both normoxia and hyperoxia was strongly dependent on lung tissue density modulated by breath-hold volume during the five repetitions. A voxel-wise correction for lung tissue density improved the repeatability of percent signal enhancement maps (coefficient of variation = 34 ± 16%). Percent signal enhancement maps were compared in 15 healthy volunteers and 10 patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), a rare cystic disease known to reduce pulmonary function. We measured a mean percent signal enhancement of 9.0 ± 3.5% at 0.55 T in healthy volunteers, and reduced signal enhancement in patients with LAM (5.4 ± 4.8%, p = 0.02). The heterogeneity, estimated by the percent of lung volume exhibiting low enhancement, was significantly increased in patients with LAM compared with healthy volunteers (11.1 ± 6.0% versus 30.5 ± 13.1%, p = 0.01), illustrating the capability to measure regional functional deficits.\n© 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

This article summarises a set of strategies designed to monitor and manage lorlatinib-related AEs that were agreed upon by a multidisciplinary panel of specialists in a meeting held in July 2020. Among the recommendations hereby described, special emphasis was placed on communication: prescribing physicians should inform patients and their families/caregivers about the likelihood and nature of lorlatinib AEs, encouraging them to report any symptoms, while at the same time reassuring them that most events are manageable and resolve spontaneously and have little to no interference with cancer treatment. Importantly, all patients should undergo a set of baseline assessments, including biochemical analysis, evaluation of cardiovascular risk, electrocardiogram (ECG), neurological evaluation and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, which should be repeated regularly during lorlatinib treatment. Supportive medications to treat or relieve lorlatinib AEs were also discussed, as were the conditions requiring specialist consultations and/or adjustments in lorlatinib therapy.

Considering the increase in ethical restrictions in animal experimentation, researchers must focus on new experimental alternatives. Two-dimensional (2D) cell cultures have complemented animal models and significantly contributed to advancing research in the life sciences. However, 2D cell cultures have several limitations in studies of cellular interactions. Three-dimensional (3D) cell cultures represent a new and robust platform for studying complex biological processes and are a promising alternative in regenerative and translational medicine.\nThree-dimensional cell cultures are obtained by combining several types of cells in integrated and self-organized systems in a 3D structure. These 3D cell culture systems represent an efficient methodological approach in studies of pathophysiology and lung therapy. More recently, complex 3D culture systems, such as lung-on-a-chip, seek to mimic the physiology of a lung in vivo through a microsystem that simulates alveolar-capillary interactions and exposure to air.

Air pollution can cause respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema in urban areas. As a natural antioxidant compound, gallic acid may be effective in controlling inflammation and preventing disease progression. In this research, we investigated the protective role of gallic acid in the inflammatory process and the possible signaling pathway in the elastase-induced emphysema. Forty-eight rats were divided into six different groups including the following: control, gallic acid (7.5, 15, and 30 mg/kg), porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE), and PPE+gallic acid 30 mg/kg. Oxidative stress indexes such as malondialdehyde and antioxidant enzyme activity were measured in all groups. The gene expression levels of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2), and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) were determined as key regulators of antioxidant and inflammation system. The PPE group showed pulmonary edema and a significant change in arterial blood gas values, which was associated with decreased antioxidant activity of enzymes and changes in NF-κB, HO-1, and Nrf2 gene expression in comparison to the control group. Co-treatment with gallic acid preserved all these changes approximately to the normal levels. The results confirmed that elastase-induced emphysema leads to lung injuries, which are associated with oxidative stress and inflammation. Also, the results suggested that gallic acid as a natural antioxidant agent can modulate the Nrf2 signaling pathway to protect the lung against elastase-induced emphysema. Therefore, we documented the evidence for the importance of NF-κB inhibitors and Nrf2 activators as a target for new treatments in respiratory dysfunction caused by oxidative agents.\n", "authors": "Farzaneh Sohrabi,Mahin Dianat,Mohammad Badavi,Maryam Radan,Seyyed Ali Mard", "pmid": "34080114", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:54.327Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:54.327Z", "publish_date": "2021-06-02", "keywords": "Emphysema", "slug": "gallic-acid-suppresses-inflammation-and-oxidative-", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 1700, "fields": {"title": "Efficacy of mycophenolate mofetil versus cyclophosphamide in systemic sclerosis-related interstitial lung disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.", "body": "\nThis study systematically compares the efficacy and adverse events of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and cyclophosphamide (CYC) in patients with systemic sclerosis-related interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD).\nThe EMBASE and PubMed databases were systematically searched to find all relevant studies.

Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation and high-flow nasal cannula oxygen may have helped avert mechanical ventilation, and this may have improved patient outcomes over the course of the study period.\nCopyright © 2021 The Authors.

L-SNAs are highly modular nanoscale assemblies defined by a dense, upright radial arrangement of oligonucleotides around a liposomal core. Herein, we establish a set of L-SNA design rules by studying the biological and immunological properties of L-SNAs as a function of liposome composition. To achieve this, we synthesized liposomes where the lipid phosphatidylcholine headgroup was held constant, while the diacyl lipid tail chain length and degree of saturation were varied, using either 1,2-dioleylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC), 1,2-dimyristoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DMPC), 1,2-dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), or 1,2-distearoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DSPC). These studies show that the identity of the constituent lipid dictates the DNA loading, cellular uptake, serum stability, in vitro immunostimulatory activity, and in vivo lymph node accumulation of the L-SNA. Furthermore, in the 4T1 mouse model of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the subcutaneous administration of immunostimulatory L-SNAs synthesized with DPPC significantly decreases the production of lung metastases and delays tumor growth as compared to L-SNAs synthesized using DOPC, due to the enhanced stability of L-SNAs synthesized with DPPC over those synthesized with DOPC. Moreover, the inclusion of cell lysates derived from Py8119 TNBC cells as antigen sources in L-SNAs leads to a significant increase in antitumor efficacy in the Py8119 model when lysates are encapsulated in the cores of L-SNAs synthesized with DPPC rather than DOPC, presumably due to increased codelivery of adjuvant and antigen to dendritic cells in vivo. This difference is further amplified when using lysates from oxidized Py8119 cells as a more potent antigen source, revealing synergy between the lysate preparation method and liposome composition in synthesizing immunotherapeutic L-SNAs. Together, this work shows that the biological properties and immunomodulatory activity of L-SNAs can be modulated by exchanging liposome components, providing another handle for the rational design of nanoscale immunotherapeutics.\n© 2021 The Authors.

Lung adenocarcinoma is the most common form of lung cancer globally. This type of lung cancer shows differences by sex, including the mutational burden, behavior, clinical characteristics, and response to treatment. The effect of sex on lung cancer patients' survival is still controversial; however, lung adenocarcinoma is considered a different disease in women and men. Moreover, lung adenocarcinoma is strongly influenced by estrogen and is also different depending on the hormonal status of the patient. Young pre-menopausal women have been explored as an independent group. They presented in more advanced stages at diagnosis, exhibited more aggressive tumors, and showed poor survival compared to men and post-menopausal women, supporting the role of sex hormones in this pathology. Several reports indicate the estrogen's role in lung carcinogenesis and tumor progression. Thus, there are currently some clinical trials testing the efficacy of antihormonal therapy in lung cancer treatment. This mini review shows the updated data about lung cancer in women, its characteristics, the etiological factors that influence carcinogenesis, and the critical role of estrogen in lung cancer and treatment.\nCopyright © 2021 Rodriguez-Lara and Avila-Costa.\n", "authors": "Vianey Rodriguez-Lara,Maria Rosa Avila-Costa", "pmid": "34079807", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:54.364Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:54.364Z", "publish_date": "2021-05-17", "keywords": "adenocarcimoma", "slug": "an-overview-of-lung-cancer-in-women-and-the-impact", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 1711, "fields": {"title": "Surgery Plus Chemotherapy Versus Surgery Alone for Limited-Stage Small-Cell Lung Cancer: A Population-Based Survival Outcome Analysis.", "body": "\nFor patients with limited-stage small-cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC), effective treatment methods still remain a clinical challenge.

However, few studies have assessed changes in the sensitivity of LUAD cells to pemetrexed under radioresistant circumstances. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to delineate changes in the sensitivity of radioresistant LUAD cells to pemetrexed and to elucidate the related mechanisms and then develop an optimal strategy to improve the cytotoxicity of pemetrexed in radioresistant LUAD cells. Our study showed a much lower efficacy of pemetrexed in radioresistant cells than in parental cells, and the mechanism of action was the significant downregulation of folate receptor alpha (FRα) by long-term fractionated radiotherapy, which resulted in less cellular pemetrexed accumulation. Interestingly, decitabine effectively reversed the decrease in FRα expression in radioresistant cells through an indirect regulatory approach. Thereafter, we designed a combination therapy of pemetrexed and decitabine and showed that the activation of FRα by decitabine sensitizes radioresistant LUAD cells to pemetrexed both in vitro and in xenografts. Our findings raised a question regarding the administration of pemetrexed to patients with LUAD exhibiting acquired radioresistance and accordingly suggested that a combination of pemetrexed and decitabine would be a promising treatment strategy.\nCopyright © 2021 Wang, Huang, Wu, Zhang, Ma, Zhu, Xia, Ma and Zhang.\n", "authors": "Yuqing Wang,Jie Huang,Qiong Wu,Jingjing Zhang,Zhiyuan Ma,Lucheng Zhu,Bin Xia,Shenglin Ma,Shirong Zhang", "pmid": "34079760", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:54.370Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:54.370Z", "publish_date": "2021-05-17", "keywords": "decitabine", "slug": "decitabine-sensitizes-the-radioresistant-lung-aden", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 1713, "fields": {"title": "Downregulation of lncRNA XR_429159.1 Linked to Brain Metastasis in Patients With Limited-Stage Small-Cell Lung Cancer.", "body": "\nPurpose: The purpose of this study was to identify aberrant long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and explore the predictive value of lncRNA expression patterns on the risk of brain metastases (BMs) in patients with limited-stage small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Patients and Methods: We executed an array of lncRNA and mRNA chip assays to examine the expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from SCLC patients with BMs and compared the expression patterns against those from patients without BMs to identify lncRNAs associated with BMs. Validation was performed against clinical data to further confirm the relationship between lncRNAs and BM. Kaplan-Meier analysis was applied to estimate the cumulative incidence of BMs, and differences between the groups were analyzed using the log-rank test. Results: The expression of 67 lncRNAs (27 upregulated and 40 downregulated) and 47 mRNAs (20 upregulated and 27 downregulated) was significantly different between the BM and non-BM groups (fold change ≥ 2.0, p-value ≤ 0.05), based on the lncRNA and mRNA chip assays. Four lncRNAs were verified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to confirm the accuracy of the microarray data, and the results of 11 patient pairs (11 patients with BM and 11 patients without BM) revealed that low LncRNA XR_429159.1 expression was a high-risk factor for BM. Further clinical data showed that the incidence of BM among 25 patients with low-level LncRNA XR_429159.1 expression was 31% at 1 year, compared with 14.3% among the 18 patients with high-level LncRNA XR_429159.1 expression (p = 0.035). Conclusion: Our present study identified the low-level expression of lncRNA XR_429159.1 as a high-risk factor among BM in patients with limited-stage SCLC. LncRNA XR_429159.1 is a critical molecule that regulates SCLC metastasis, involved in the neuroepithelial transforming gene 1 (NET1) pathway, and serum levels of this lncRNA are significantly associated with the risk of BM.\nCopyright © 2021 Li, Jing, Jia, Zhai, Zhu and Yu.\n", "authors": "Ji Li,Wang Jing,Wenxiao Jia,Xiaoyang Zhai,Hui Zhu,Jinming Yu", "pmid": "34079751", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:54.373Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:54.373Z", "publish_date": "2021-05-17", "keywords": "NET", "slug": "downregulation-of-lncrna-xr_4291591-linked-to-brai", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 1714, "fields": {"title": "Imaging features of mycotic aortic aneurysms.", "body": "\nInfectious aortitis (IA) is a rare and life-threatening cardiovascular disease.

Current state-of-the-art imaging modalities-including computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/CT-can detect infected aneurysms in clinically suspicious cases.

Enlarged lymph nodes are often found adjacent to the aneurysm, while iliopsoas abscess (IPA), spondylitis, and aortic fistulas are commonly associated complications. After surgery or endovascular repair, radiological features-including ectopic gas, peri-graft fluid, thickening of adjacent bowel, pseudoaneurysm formed at the graft anastomosis, and increased uptake of FDG-may indicate an infection of aortic graft.

CapsNet utilizes an activity vector to record the relative spatial relationship of image elements that can subsequently better delineate the global image characteristics. CT images of 72 adenocarcinoma (AC) and 54 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) patients were retrospectively collected from a single clinical center. The cancer region on the CT image was manually segmented for every subject by an experienced radiologist, and CapsNet, CNN, and four radiomics models were then used to construct the recognition model.\nThe study demonstrated that CapsNet achieved the best discriminative performance (accuracy 81.3%, specificity 80.7%, sensitivity 82.2%) although its area under the curve was just marginally better than that of the optimal random forest (RF) based radiomics model.

Immunohistochemistry analysis was performed to detect MCTS1 expression in LUAD tissues and normal tissues. The MTT, colony formation, EdU, flow cytometry, wound healing and Transwell assays were performed to assess the proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion of LUAD cells. Western blot analysis was performed to detect protein expression levels. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of MCTS1 on the progression of LUAD and the potential mechanisms underlying its effects. The results demonstrated that MCTS1 expression was upregulated in LUAD tissues and cells, which was associated with an unfavorable outcome in patients with LUAD. MCTS1 knockdown inhibited LUAD progression by suppressing cell viability and motility, and promoting apoptosis. In addition, E2F1 protein expression was attenuated following MCTS1 knockdown. The silencing MCTS1-induced inhibitory effect on LUAD malignancy was reversed following overexpression of E2F1 by modulating the c-Myc signaling pathway.

Peritoneal cDC1s were superior to cDC2s in activating OVA-specific CD8 T cells, while both cDCs were similar in stimulating OVA-specific CD4 T cells. Each peritoneal cDC subset differentially regulated the homing properties of CD8 T cells. CD8 T cells stimulated by cDC1s displayed a higher level of lung-homing receptor CCR4, whereas those stimulated by cDC2s prominently expressed various homing receptors including gut-homing molecules CCR9 and α4β7. Also, we found that cDC1s played a dominating role over cDC2s in controlling the overall gene expression of CD8 T cells. Soluble factor(s) emanating from CD8 T cells stimulated by peritoneal cDC1s were responsible for mediating this dominance of cDC1s, and we identified IL-2 as a soluble factor regulating the global gene expression of T cells. Collectively, our study indicates that different peritoneal cDC subsets effectively diversify T cell responses by altering the level of cytokines, such as IL-2, in the milieu.\nCopyright © 2021 Sohn, Na, Shin, Ryu, Park, In, Choi, Park, Hwang, Chu and Park.\n", "authors": "Moah Sohn,Hye Young Na,Hyun Soo Shin,Seul Hye Ryu,Sejung Park,Hyunju In,Wanho Choi,Ji Soo Park,Soomin Hwang,Min Kyung Chu,Chae Gyu Park", "pmid": "34079542", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:54.413Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:54.413Z", "publish_date": "2021-05-17", "keywords": "T cell – DC interactions", "slug": "global-gene-expression-of-t-cells-is-differentiall", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 1728, "fields": {"title": "The Role of Tumor Inflammatory Microenvironment in Lung Cancer.", "body": "\nLung cancer is the most common and fatal malignant tumor in the world.

Its hallmark is lung damage, characterised by fixed airflow obstruction (FAO), bronchiectasis and lung fibrosis. It has a number of monikers including severe asthma with fungal sensitisation (SAFS) and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis/mycosis (ABPA/M), but these exclusive terms constitute only sub-sets of the condition. In order to capture the full extent of the syndrome we prefer the inclusive term allergic fungal airway disease (AFAD), the criteria for which are IgE sensitisation to relevant fungi in association with airway disease. The primary fungus involved is Aspergillus fumigatus, but a number of other thermotolerant species from several genera have been implicated. The unifying mechanism involves germination of inhaled fungal spores in the lung in the context of IgE sensitisation, leading to a persistent and vigorous eosinophilic inflammatory response in association with release of fungal proteases. Most allergenic fungi, including Alternaria and Cladosporium species, are not thermotolerant and cannot germinate in the airways so only act as aeroallergens and do not cause AFAD. Studies of the airway mycobiome have shown that A. fumigatus colonises the normal as much as the asthmatic airway, suggesting it is the tendency to become IgE-sensitised that is the critical triggering factor for AFAD rather than colonisation per se. Treatment is aimed at preventing exacerbations with glucocorticoids and increasingly by the use of anti-T2 biological therapies. Anti-fungal therapy has a limited place in management, but is an effective treatment for fungal bronchitis which complicates AFAD in about 10% of cases.\n© 2021 Wardlaw et al.\n", "authors": "Andrew J Wardlaw,Eva-Maria Rick,Leyla Pur Ozyigit,Alys Scadding,Erol A Gaillard,Catherine H Pashley", "pmid": "34079294", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:54.432Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:54.432Z", "publish_date": "2021-05-25", "keywords": "ABPA", "slug": "new-perspectives-in-the-diagnosis-and-management-o", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 1735, "fields": {"title": "Silencing HIPPI Suppresses Tumor Progression in Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer by Inhibiting DNA Replication.", "body": "\nNon-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common form of lung cancer, accounting for approximately 80%-85% of all cases of lung cancer.

Targeting HIPPI by RNA interference inhibits NSCLC cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. HIPPI silencing also attenuates cell migration and invasion and enhances cisplatin sensitivity in NSCLC cells. Mechanistic investigation suggests that HIPPI can positively regulate the expression of MCM2, MCM6 and MCM8, which are key regulators of DNA replication. Furthermore, consistent with HIPPI, MCM2, MCM6 and MCM8 are also upregulated in NSCLC tissues.\nOur study highlights the importance of HIPPI for tumor biology in NSCLC and suggests that HIPPI may be a potential therapeutic target for NSCLC treatment.\n© 2021 Xie et al.\n", "authors": "Guanghui Xie,Yongwen Li,Yongjun Jiang,Xian Ye,Jianfeng Tang,Jun Chen", "pmid": "34079292", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:54.434Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:54.435Z", "publish_date": "2021-05-27", "keywords": "DNA replication", "slug": "silencing-hippi-suppresses-tumor-progression-in-no", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 1736, "fields": {"title": "Targeted Sequencing Facilitated Diagnosis of an Uncommon Patient Harboring Both Multiple Primary and Intrapulmonary Metastatic Lung Cancer: A Case Report.", "body": "\nEstimated to comprise approximately 10% of lung cancer cases, multiple pulmonary lesions pose a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge in thoracic oncology.

To assess the physiological effects of HBBS base editing, we delivered ABE8e-NRCH and guide RNA into HSPCs from a humanized SCD mouse6 and then transplanted these cells into irradiated mice. After sixteen weeks, Makassar β-globin represented 79% of β-globin protein in blood, and hypoxia-induced sickling was reduced threefold. Mice that received base-edited HSPCs showed near-normal haematological parameters and reduced splenic pathology compared to mice that received unedited cells. Secondary transplantation of edited bone marrow confirmed that the gene editing was durable in long-term haematopoietic stem cells and showed that HBBS-to-HBBG editing of 20% or more is sufficient for phenotypic rescue. Base editing of human HSPCs avoided the p53 activation and larger deletions that have been observed following Cas9 nuclease treatment.

These findings underscore the role of SARS-CoV-2 surface proteins, particularly the understudied E protein, in driving cell specific inflammation and their potential for therapeutic intervention.\nCopyright © 2021 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.\n", "authors": "Gautam Anand,Alexandra M Perry,Celeste L Cummings,Emma Raymond,Regina A Clemens,Ashley L Steed", "pmid": "34078711", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:54.470Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:54.470Z", "publish_date": "2021-06-02", "keywords": "", "slug": "surface-proteins-of-sars-cov-2-drive-airway-epithe", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 1748, "fields": {"title": "Recovering the lung transplant service after COVID-19 - experience at the Freeman Hospital, Newcastle.", "body": "", "authors": "Falak Umair,Muhammad Waseem Athar,Arun Nair,James Lordan,Andrew Fisher,Gerard Meachery", "pmid": "34078697", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:54.472Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:54.472Z", "publish_date": null, "keywords": "", "slug": "recovering-the-lung-transplant-service-after-covid", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 1749, "fields": {"title": "Genetic Ancestry Affects Somatic Alterations in Lung Cancers.", "body": "", "authors": "Luiz H Araujo,Vladmir C Cordeiro de Lima,David P Carbone", "pmid": "34078658", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:54.475Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:54.475Z", "publish_date": null, "keywords": "", "slug": "genetic-ancestry-affects-somatic-alterations-in-lu", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 1750, "fields": {"title": "Point-of-care ultrasonography for the hospitalist.", "body": "\nPoint-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS) has emerged as a vital tool in medicine.

This biomimetic system is based on the lipid nanovesicle coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) terminally conjugated with a cyclic RGD (cRGD) peptide. Our experiments with human blood demonstrated its highly selective binding to activated platelets and efficient tPA release at a thrombus site under both static and physiological flow conditions.

Evaluation of the questionnaire included an assessment of internal consistency and factor analysis. The occurrence of potential barriers in the patient sample was evaluated using descriptive statistics. To identify patient subpopulations, hierarchical cluster analysis was performed using ABQ-IVT answers as predictors.

Within the reliability analysis, the ABQ-IVT was reduced to 17 items. The condensed questionnaire demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.78), and factor analysis showed no evidence for subscales of the questionnaire. Nearly half of the patients (49%) reported being affected by at least three different barriers. On average, a patient was affected by 3.1 barriers.

Surgical PAB was performed on mice to induce RV pressure overload and myocardial remodeling. bSSFP-CMR, tagged CMR, and intra-cardiac catheterization were performed on 12 PAB and 9 control mice (Sham) 7 weeks after surgery with identical post-processing as in the aforementioned patient studies. RV_Ees was assessed via the single beat method.\nLV torsion rate was significantly reduced under hypertensive conditions in both PAB mice (p = 0.004) and pediatric PAH patients (p < 0.001). This decrease in LV torsion rate correlated significantly with a decrease in RV_Ees in PAB (r = 0.91, p = 0.05) and PAH subjects (r = 0.51, p = 0.04). In order to compare combined metrics of LV torsion rate and strain parameters principal component analysis (PCA) was used. PCA revealed grouping of PAH patients with PAB mice and control subjects with Sham mice. Similar to LV torsion rate, LV global peak circumferential, radial, and longitudinal strain were significantly (p < 0.05) reduced under hypertensive conditions in both PAB mice and children with PAH.\nThe PAB mouse model resembles PAH-associated myocardial mechanics and may provide a potential model to study mechanisms of RV/LV interdependency.\n", "authors": "Melanie J Dufva,Mario Boehm,Kenzo Ichimura,Uyen Truong,Xulei Qin,Jennifer Tabakh,Kendall S Hunter,Dunbar Ivy,Edda Spiekerkoetter,Vitaly O Kheyfets", "pmid": "34078382", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:54.517Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:54.517Z", "publish_date": "2021-06-03", "keywords": "Cardiovascular magnetic resonance", "slug": "pulmonary-arterial-banding-in-mice-may-be-a-suitab", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 1763, "fields": {"title": "Correction to: Exosomal miR-126 blocks the development of non-small cell lung cancer through the inhibition of ITGA6.", "body": "", "authors": "Mingjun Li,Qianqian Wang,Xiaofei Zhang,Ningning Yan,Xingya Li", "pmid": "34078381", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:54.519Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:23:54.519Z", "publish_date": "2021-06-02", "keywords": "", "slug": "correction-to-exosomal-mir-126-blocks-the-developm", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 1764, "fields": {"title": "Serum S100 calcium-binding protein A4 as a novel predictive marker of acute exacerbation of interstitial pneumonia after surgery for lung cancer.", "body": "\nAcute exacerbation (AE) of interstitial pneumonia (IP) is the most fatal complication after lung resection for lung cancer.

Suicidal ideation was measured using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) suicide item at 3, 5, 7, 14 and 30 days post infusion. Clinically significant suicidal ideation was defined as a MADRS suicide item score ≥2. Forty patients who received IV ketamine and 16 who received IV midazolam had suicide item scores of ≥2 at baseline (IV ketamine group mean 2.90±0.74; IV midazolam group 2.69±0.70). The mean suicide scores of these groups differed significantly from each other on day 30; the IV ketamine group had a lower mean score than controls (2.03±1.59 vs. 3.00±1.41, t-test p = 0.049; Hedges' g 0.71).

A single infusion of IV ketamine may reduce suicidal ideation in TRD out to 30 days post infusion, but early anti-suicidal effects appear to diminish rapidly. This post-hoc analysis was not powered to compare different doses of ketamine. A single infusion of IV ketamine might have a role as an adjunct to standard treatments in patients with TRD and suicidal ideation. Trial registration: NCT01920555.\nCopyright © 2021.

To monitor the orientation of target molecules by FPM, target molecules need to be labeled with fluorophores in a sterically constrained manner, so that the fluorophores do not freely rotate. Recently, a versatile probe for such labeling using fluorescent proteins, POLArIS (Probe for Orientation and Localization Assessment, recognizing specific Intracellular Structures of interest), was reported. POLArIS is a fusion protein consisting of a non-immunoglobulin-based recombinant binder Affimer and a green fluorescent protein (GFP), where the Affimer and GFP are rigidly connected to each other. POLArIS probe for molecules of interest can be developed through phage display screening of Affimer. This screening is followed by the rigid connection of fluorescent proteins to the selected Affimers. The Affimer-based POLArIS, however, cannot be used with animal immune libraries for selecting specific binder clones. In addition, multi-color FPM by POLArIS was not available due to the lack of color variations of POLArIS. In this study, we have developed new versions of POLArIS with nanobodies, which are compatible with animal immune libraries, and expanded color variations of POLArIS with cyan/green/yellow/red fluorescent proteins, enabling multi-color orientation imaging for multiple targets. Using nanobody-based POLArIS orientation probes, we performed two-color FPM of F-actin and vimentin in living cells. Furthermore, we made nanobody-based POLArIS probes that have different dipole orientations for adjusting the orientation of fluorescence polarization with respect to the target molecules. These nanobody-based POLArIS with options of colors and dipole orientations will enhance the performance of this probe for broader applications of fluorescence polarization imaging in living cells, tissues, and whole organisms.\nCopyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Results obtained from samples collected at 11 dpi are referred as EL (early lesions) and results obtained from samples collected at later times (18-31 dpi) are referred as LL (late lesions). Marked differences were found in the cytokine transcripts in brain and eye. While proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-8, IL-18), iNOS, IFN-α, IFN-γ, and IL-15 were upregulated in the brain during EL and LL, only IL-8 and IFN-γ were upregulated in the eye at both times (EL and LL).

Blockade of IL-6, by Tocilizumab, is used in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and those diagnosed with cytokine storm. However, brain-produced IL-6 has recently emerged as a critical mediator of gut/adipose communication with the brain. Central nervous system (CNS) IL-6 is engaged by peripheral and central signals regulating energy homeostasis. IL-6 is critical for mediating hypophagia and weight loss effects of a GLP-1 analog, exendin-4, a clinically utilized drug. However, neuroanatomical substrates and behavioral mechanisms of brain IL-6 energy balance control remain poorly understood. We propose that the lateral hypothalamus (LH) is an IL-6-harboring brain region, key to food intake and food reward control. Microinjections of IL-6 into the LH reduced chow and palatable food intake in male rats. In contrast, female rats responded with reduced motivated behavior for sucrose, measured by the progressive ratio operant conditioning test, a behavioral mechanism previously not linked to IL-6. To test whether IL-6, produced in the LH, is necessary for ingestive and motivated behaviors, and body weight homeostasis, virogenetic knockdown by infusion of AAV-siRNA-IL6 into the LH was utilized. Attenuation of LH IL-6 resulted in a potent increase in sucrose-motivated behavior, without any effect on ingestive behavior or body weight in female rats. In contrast, the treatment did not affect any parameters measured (chow intake, sucrose-motivated behavior, locomotion, and body weight) in chow-fed males. However, when challenged with a high-fat/high-sugar diet, the male LH IL-6 knockdown rats displayed rapid weight gain and hyperphagia. Together, our data suggest that LH-produced IL-6 is necessary and sufficient for ingestive behavior and weight homeostasis in male rats. In females, IL-6 in the LH plays a critical role in food-motivated, but not ingestive behavior control or weight regulation. Thus, collectively these data support the idea that brain-produced IL-6 engages the hypothalamus to control feeding behavior.\nCopyright © 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

However, the brain changes in NMOSD patients with NP have rarely been studied.\nThe aim of the cross-sectional and follow-up longitudinal study was to investigate the brain changes in NMOSD patients with NP.\nIn the cross-sectional study, comparisons were performed between groups with NP (W-NP) and without NP (Wo-NP), and age, sex and years of education were adjusted. We compared the voxel-wise whole-brain gray matter (GM) volume, cortical thickness (CT), cortical surface area (CSA) and local gyrification index (LGI). Probabilistic tractography started from regions with significant between-group differences in GM volume, CT, CSA and LGI. We also compared fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD) and axial diffusivity (AD) of the white matter (WM) skeleton using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS). In the longitudinal study, the patients were followed for 2.0±0.0 years and underwent the same imaging scanning as the cross-sectional study. Changes of the CT, CSA, LGI and WM were obtained.\nPatients in the W-NP group were older than those in the Wo-NP group and showed significantly reduced LGI of the left temporal lobe and adjacent regions(regions of interest, ROIs), which participated in neuropathic pain processing, possibly by emotion and attention control. Probabilistic tractography started from ROIs, and the generated WM tracts showed decreased MD and RD in the W-NP group compared to the Wo-NP group. Using TBSS, both MD and RD decreased in extensive WM skeleton in the right hemisphere of the patients in the W-NP group. Additionally, in the follow-up longitudinal study, compared with patients in the Wo-NP group, patients in the W-NP group showed lower mean reduction rates of LGI of ROIs, and less increase of FA and more increases of MD, AD and RD in the extensive WM skeleton.\nThese findings support the hypothesis that brain changes might correlate with NP in NMOSD patients and predict the changes related to NP over time.\nCopyright © 2021.

The objective was to generate a multidisciplinary consensus on research priorities in MS for patients care in LATAM by involving healthcare professionals and MS patient associations. METHODS: consensus was reached through a four-step modified Delphi method designed to identify and rate research priorities in MS in LATAM. The process consisted of two qualitative assessments, a general ranking phase and a consensus meeting followed by a more detailed ranking phase RESULTS: a total of 62 participants (35 neurologists, 4 nurses, 12 kinesiologists, 7 neuropsychologists and 4 patient association members) developed the process. At the final ranking stage following the consensus meeting, each participant provided their final rankings, and the top priority research questions were outlined. 11 research priorities were identified focusing on healthcare access, costs of the disease, physical and cognitive evaluation and rehabilitation, quality of life, symptoms management, prognostic factors, the need of MS care units and patient's management in emergencies like COVID-19. CONCLUSION: this work establishes MS research priorities in LATAM from multiple perspectives. To pursue the actions suggested could launch the drive to obtain information that will help us to better understand the disease in our region and, especially, to better care for affected patients.\nCopyright © 2021.

We were interested in assessing the dynamic cerebral substrate of such interaction between language and declarative memory, as the composite function, in healthy controls (HC, N = 19) and patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE, N = 16). Our assumption was that the language and declarative memory integration is based on a language-and-memory network (LMN) that is dynamic and reconfigures according to task demands and brain status. Therefore, we explored two types of LMN dynamics, a state reconfiguration (intrinsic resting-state compared to extrinsic state assessed with a sentence recall task) and a reorganization of state reconfiguration (TLE compared to HC). The dynamics was evaluated in terms of segregation (community or module detection) and integration (connector hubs). In HC, the level of segregation was the same in both states and the mechanism of LMN state reconfiguration was shown through module change of key language and declarative memory regions with integrative roles. In TLE patients, the reorganization of LMN state reconfiguration was reflected in segregation increase and extrinsic modules that were based on shorter-distance connections. While lateral and mesial temporal regions enabled state reconfiguration in HC, these regions showed reduced flexibility in TLE. We discuss our results in a connectomic perspective and propose a dynamic model of language and declarative memory functioning. We claim that complex and interactive cognitive functions, such as language and declarative memory, should be investigated dynamically, considering the interaction between cognitive networks.\nCopyright © 2021 The Author(s).

The current study is a preliminary neuroimaging study of the neural correlates of posttraumatic anhedonia symptoms. Resting-state fMRI data were acquired from 88 Chinese earthquake survivors. Whole brain analyses and exploratory ROI-to-ROI analyses were performed to examine the relationship between posttraumatic anhedonia symptoms and resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of reward-related subcortical nucleus including nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum. The rsFC between left ventral pallidum and areas of bilateral posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and precuneus cortex were found lower in the high posttraumatic anhedonia group, after controlling for sex, age and other posttraumatic stress symptoms. The rsFC between left ventral pallidum and PCC and the rsFC between left ventral pallidum and lateral parietal cortex were significantly lower in the high anhedonia group. Our findings suggest that decreased functional connectivity between the ventral pallidum and the brain default mode network (DMN) regions could be the neural correlates of posttraumatic anhedonia symptoms.\nCopyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Destroying vibration signals is an alternative biological method for pest control. However, the regulatory mechanism of AV in female BPHs remains elusive, which presents an obstacle to pest control. We observed that before mating female BHPs emitted abdominal vibration signals that disappeared immediately after mating and reappeared after 6 days. Therefore, ovarian and brain samples of female BPHs from Unmated-6h+ (with AV), Mated-6h- (without AV) and Mated-6d+ (with AV) individuals were collected for transcript analyses. By transcriptional sequencing analyses, 33 candidate genes that might involve in the regulation of female AV were obtained. After selecting 4 candidate genes of them for verification by RNA interference (RNAi), it was found that interference of juvenile hormone binding protein (JHBP) could greatly reduce the probability and frequency of AV for female BPHs. In general, this study identified AV-related candidate genes in female BPHs through transcriptome analyses and provided an important basis for future research on pest control in BPHs.\nCopyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

BBB permeability, glial activation and neuroinflammation were investigated in the hypothalamic medial preoptic area (mPOA) and hippocampus involved, respectively on the reproductive and cognitive functions. Exposure to DEHP alone or in a phthalate mixture increased BBB permeability and affected the endothelial accessory tight junction protein zona occludens-1 and caveolae protein Cav-1 in the mPOA and the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 areas. This was associated with an inflammatory profile including astrocyte activation accompanied by enhanced expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase in the mPOA, and a microglial activation in the mPOA and the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 areas. The protein levels of the inflammatory molecule cyclooxygenase-2 were increased in activated microglial cells of the exposed mPOA. None of the major effects induced by DEHP alone or in a mixture was detected in the hippocampal dendate gyrus.

Several lines of evidence have shown that Lgr5+ progenitor cells can spontaneously regenerate new HCs after HC loss at the neonatal stage, and most of which are immature. IHCs are resistant to ototoxic drugs and noise and cannot be ablated efficiently in order to precisely investigate IHC regeneration in existing hearing injury models, and thus we generated a new transgenic mouse model by inserting diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) under the control of the Vglut3 promoter. In this model, IHCs were selectively ablated in a dose-dependent manner after the injection of diphtheria toxin (DT) at the neonatal stage, while OHCs remained intact with normal hair bundle structures until adulthood. With this IHC-specific injury model, we observed HC regeneration from Lgr5+ progenitors after IHC ablation at the neonatal stage. Some of the newly generated HCs replaced the lost IHCs in-situ and re-build the structure of the organ of Corti through the asymmetrical mitosis of progenitor cells. While, the majority of the regenerated HCs did not survive until adulthood, and the loss of spiral ganglion neurons was observed after the IHC ablation, which led to profound hearing loss after DT injection in Vglut3DTR+ mice at the neonatal stage. The model presented here shows promise for investigating the mechanisms behind IHC loss and subsequent regeneration.\nCopyright © 2021.

To achieve a homogeneous representation of the visual world across eye movements, the visual system needs to compensate for these differences. By introducing subtle changes between peripheral and foveal inputs across saccades, one can test this compensation. We morphed shapes between a triangle and a circle and presented two different change directions (circularity decrease or increase) at varying magnitudes across a saccade. In a change-discrimination task, observers disproportionally often reported percepts of circularity increase. To test the relationship with visual-field differences, we measured perception when shapes were exclusively presented either in the periphery (before a saccade), or in the fovea (after a saccade). We found that overall shapes were perceived as more circular before than after a saccade and the more pronounced this difference was for a participant, the smaller was their circularity-increase bias in the change-discrimination task. We propose that visual-field differences have a direct and an indirect influence on transsaccadic perception of shape change. The direct influence is based on the distinct appearance of shape in the central and peripheral visual field in a trial, causing an increase of the perceptual magnitude of circularity-decrease changes. The indirect influence is based on long-term build-up of transsaccadic expectations; if a change is opposite (circularity increase) to the expectation (circularity decrease), it should elicit a strong error signal facilitating change detection. We discuss the concept of transsaccadic expectations and theoretical implications for transsaccadic perception of other feature changes.\nCopyright © 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

Together with systematic desensitization techniques, it has proven to be effective in helping with social cognition mapping. These techniques work by engaging an awake patient in social recognition tasks with a neuropsychologist´s avatar during surgery. The authors advocate for the use of a VR protocol as a functional tool in awake-patient brain tumor surgery by using it as a complement during cognitive screening, language mapping, anxiety measuring, and post-surgical cognitive rehabilitation programs. This review serves to present the current literature discussing the integration of VR into the mapping portion of awake brain tumor surgery and describes a proposed protocol to improve upon existing paradigms. In doing so, the authors propose various intraoperative VR tasks and the respective domains that can be tested.\nCopyright © 2021.

Unlike all teleosts studied to date, the Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) is a short day breeder with the reduction in day-length from the summer solstice stimulating gametogenesis. Cod specific orthologues of eya3, tshβ and dio2 were identified and their expression was monitored in the brain and pituitary of cod held under either stimulated or inhibited photoperiod conditions. While no differential expression was apparent in brain dio2 &tshβ and pituitary tshβ, there was significant temporal variation in expression of pituitary eya3 under the SNP treatment, with expression level elevating in association with active gametogenesis. Under the LL treatment, sexual maturation was inhibited and there was a corresponding suppression of eya3 expression. In a second study the impact of size/energetic status on the initiation of sexual maturation was investigated. In the feed restricted population maturation was significantly suppressed (5% sexually mature) compared to the ab libitum fed stock (95% sexually mature) with there being a concomitant significant suppression in pituitary eya3 expression. Overall, these results suggest that pituitary eya3 has the potential to act as an integrator of both environmental and energetic regulation of sexual maturation of cod. Being the first account of eya3 induction in a short day breeding teleost, the conserved association with stimulation of reproduction and not seasonal state indicates that the upstream drivers which initiate the pathway differ among vertebrates according to their breeding strategies, but the pathway itself and its role in the reproductive cascade appears to be conserved across the vertebrate clade.\nCopyright © 2021.

No study, however, has examined whether semantic and non-semantic demands are reflected in a common neural code within regions specifically implicated in semantic control. Using functional MRI and univariate parametric modulation analysis as well as multivariate pattern analysis, we found that semantic and non-semantic demands gave rise to both similar and distinct neural responses across control-related networks. Though activity patterns in SCN and MDN could decode the difficulty of both semantic and verbal working memory decisions, there was no shared common neural coding of cognitive demands in SCN regions. In contrast, regions in MDN showed common patterns across manipulations of semantic and working memory control demands, with successful cross-classification of difficulty across tasks. Therefore, SCN and MDN can be dissociated according to the information they maintain about cognitive demands.\nCopyright © 2021.

The conversion of oral turinabol was found to be selective resulting in the formation of only one product, as shown by HPLC analysis. To produce sufficient amounts of this product for NMR analysis, a system expressing human full-length CYP46A1 and CPR on a bicistronic vector was successfully developed realizing the selective cholesterol 24-hydroxylation in E. coli in mg amounts. Using this novel whole-cell system, the conversion of oral turinabol was performed and the product of this conversion by CYP46A1 was isolated and identified as 16β-hydroxy oral turinabol by NMR.\nCopyright © 2021.

Various plant alkaloids have been investigated for their capacity to modulate mitochondrial activities. In this study, we used isolated mitochondria from mouse brain and liver tissues to assess nicotine, anatabine and anabasine, three alkaloids found in tobacco plant, for potential modulatory activity on mitochondrial bioenergetics parameters. All alkaloids decreased basal oxygen consumption of mouse brain mitochondria in a dose-dependent manner without any effect on the ADP-stimulated respiration. None of the alkaloids, at 1 nM or 1.25 μM concentrations, influenced the maximal rate of swelling of brain mitochondria. In contrast to brain mitochondria, 1.25 μM anatabine, anabasine and nicotine increased maximal rate of swelling of liver mitochondria suggesting a toxic effect. Only at 1 mM concentration, anatabine slowed down the maximal rate of Ca2+-induced swelling and increased the time needed to reach the maximal rate of swelling. The observed mitochondrial bioenergetic effects are probably mediated through a pathway independent of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, as quantitative proteomic analysis could not confirm their expression in pure mitochondrial fractions isolated from mouse brain tissue.\nCopyright © 2021 The Author(s).

In this review, we summarize studies using various mouse models with genetically altered AMPARs and focus on their roles in basal synaptic transmission, LTP, and LTD at the hippocampal CA1 synapse. These studies provide strong evidence that there are multiple forms of LTP and LTD at this synapse which can be induced by various induction protocols, and they are differentially regulated by different AMPAR subunits and domains.

We also present the cryoelectron tomography-solved dimeric structure of Reelin CF and support it using several other biophysical techniques. Our findings suggest that Reelin CF forms a covalent parallel dimer with some degree of flexibility between the two protein chains.

CIB2 and CIB3 bind to TMC1/2 through a domain in TMC1/2 flanked by transmembrane domains 2 and 3. The co-crystal structure of the CIB-binding domain in TMC1 with CIB3 reveals that interactions are mediated through a conserved CIB hydrophobic groove, similar to KChIP1 binding of Kv4.

This study aimed at evaluating SO in the performance of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) on a word list recall task in order to investigate the basic mechanisms of episodic memory impairment that are frequently observed in these patients. For this purpose, 56 PD patients, who were stratified according to the presence and quality of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and a group of healthy controls (HCs) were administered a word list task and an extensive battery of neuropsychological tests. Results showed that recall accuracy on the word list task progressively decreased passing from HC to PD patients without cognitive impairment, to patients with single-domain dysexecutive MCI and to patients with multiple-domain dysexecutive and amnesic MCI. Conversely, only the latter PD group showed a lower SO score than that achieved by the other groups. In the overall PD group, correlational and regression analyses demonstrated that SO scores and a composite score of executive functions were not reciprocally related, but both provided an independent and significant contribution to the prediction of word list recall accuracy.

Successful and sustained obesity treatment is currently limited to bariatric surgery. Modulating the release of gut hormones is considered promising to mimic bariatric surgery with its beneficial effects on food intake, body weight and blood glucose levels. The gut peptide secretin was the first molecule to be termed a hormone; nevertheless, it only recently has been established as a legitimate anorexigenic peptide. In contrast to gut hormones that crosstalk with the brain either directly or by afferent neuronal projections, secretin mediates meal-associated brown fat thermogenesis to induce meal termination, thereby qualifying this physiological mechanism as an attractive, peripheral target for the treatment of obesity. In this perspective, it is of pivotal interest to deepen our yet superficial knowledge on the physiological roles of secretin as well as meal-associated thermogenesis in energy balance and body weight regulation. Of note, the emerging differences between meal-associated thermogenesis and cold-induced thermogenesis must be taken into account. In fact, there is no correlation between these two entities. In addition, the investigation of potential effects of secretin in hedonic-driven food intake, bariatric surgery as well as chronic treatment using suitable application strategies to overcome pharmacokinetic limitations will provide further insight into its potential to influence energy balance. The aim of this article is to review the facts on secretin's metabolic effects, address prevailing gaps in our knowledge, and provide an overview on the opportunities and challenges of the therapeutic potential of secretin in body weight control.\n© The Author(s) 2021.

These highly malignant tumors involve the bones and commonly occur in children. Ewing sarcoma of the skull bone accounts for only 1% of all Ewing sarcomas, with primary skull base Ewing sarcoma occurring in less than 1% of cases. We present a case of skull base Ewing sarcoma with complete symptom recovery and near-total radiological resolution. CASE REPORT A 4-year-old girl initially presented with a 2-month history of vomiting, poor oral intake, weight loss, and gradual visual deterioration followed by acute symptoms of fever, breathing difficulties, and seizure. Initial computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain displayed a large sinonasal mass with extensive regional infiltration and bony destruction and no evidence of distant metastasis. A transnasal biopsy was taken. The histopathology result revealed features of skull base Ewing sarcoma. The child was given a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, to which she responded well, with a minimal residual tumor. CONCLUSIONS Skull base Ewing sarcoma is a rare entity, presenting a challenge to the reporting radiologists. Differential diagnoses of esthesioneuroblastoma, olfactory neuroepithelioma, and, more commonly, sinonasal carcinoma can be misleading since they have similar radiological appearances to skull base Ewing sarcoma, which differs in treatment regimen and prognosis. Therefore, a combination of histopathological appearance, radiographic findings, and clinical correlation is important to determine the correct diagnosis, establish the appropriate treatment regime, and improve the patient's survival.\n", "authors": "Mohd Syafiek Abdul Haq Saifuddin,Chiak Yot Ng,Mohd Shafie Abdullah", "pmid": "34089579", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:02.864Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:02.864Z", "publish_date": "2021-06-05", "keywords": "", "slug": "skull-base-primary-ewing-sarcoma-a-radiological-ex", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 1813, "fields": {"title": "Increased spindle density correlates with sleep continuity improvements following an 8-week course of a melatonin agonist in people with depression: A proof-of-concept study with agomelatine.", "body": "\nSleep fragmentation and reductions in sleep spindles have been observed in individuals with depression. Sleep spindles are known to play a protective role for sleep, and there are indications that melatonin agents can enhance spindles in healthy people. Whether agomelatine, a melatonin agonist indicated for the treatment of depression, may increase spindle density sufficiently to impact sleep continuity in people with depression remains unknown. This proof-of-concept study investigated changes in spindles following agomelatine intake in young adults with depression and assessed how they may relate to potential changes in sleep continuity and depressive symptoms. This study was based on an open-label design. Fifteen participants between 17 and 28 years of age (mean =22; SD=3.8) with a diagnosis of a depressive disorder underwent polysomnography before and after an intervention including a 1h psychoeducation session centered on sleep and circadian rhythms, and an 8-week course of agomelatine (25-50 mg) with a guided sleep phase advance. Fast spindle density significantly increased from pre to post-intervention. This increase in spindle density significantly correlated with a reduction in wake after sleep onset, and a similar trend was found with increased sleep efficiency. There was no significant correlation between spindle parameters and depressive symptoms. These findings suggest that agomelatine may contribute to enhanced sleep consolidation, notably through the modulation of spindle production. This should be confirmed by larger randomized control trials.\nThis article is protected by copyright.

Mitochondria are essential for neuronal function, given the high energy demands of the human brain.

Emerging evidence suggests that mitochondria are important not only for mature postmitotic neurons but also for the regulation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) during the process of neurogenesis. These recent findings put mitochondria as central regulator of cell fate decisions during brain development. OXPHOS mutations may disrupt the function of NPCs and thereby impair the metabolic programming required for neural fate commitment. Promoting the mitochondrial function of NPCs could therefore represent a novel interventional approach against incurable mitochondrial diseases.\n© 2021 The Authors.

First, we trained a lightweight CNN to detect glioma and mask the suspected region to process large batch of MRI images. Second, we employed a differential evolution algorithm to search a feature space, which composed of 416-dimensions radiomics features extracted from 4 sequences of MRIs and 128-dimensions high-order features extracted by the CNN, to generate an optimal feature combination for pixel classification. Finally, we trained an EL classifier using the optimal feature combination to segment whole tumor (WT) and its subregions including non-enhancing tumor (NET), peritumoral edema (ED), and enhancing tumor (ET) in the suspected region. Experiments were carried out on 300 glioma patients from the BraTS2019 dataset using 5-fold cross-validation, the model was independently validated using the rest 35 patients from the same database.\nThe approach achieved a detection accuracy of 98.8% using four MRIs. The Dice coefficients (and standard deviations) were 0.852±0.057, 0.844±0.046, and 0.799±0.053 for segmentation of WT (NET+ET+ED), tumor core (NET+ET), and ET, respectively. The sensitivities and specificities were 0.873±0.074, 0.863±0.072, and 0.852±0.082; the specificities were 0.994±0.005, 0.994±0.005, and 0.995±0.004 for the WT, tumor core and ET, respectively. The performances and calculation times were compared with the state-of-the-art approaches, our approach yielded a better overall performance with average processing time of 139.5 sec per set of four sequence MRIs.\nWe demonstrated a robust and computational cost-effective hybrid segmentation approach for glioma and its subregions on multi-sequence MR images.

In vivo microdialysis experiments demonstrated that calorie restriction induced an increase in ATP level in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in naïve mice but this effect disappeared in IP3R2-knockout mice, suggesting a role of astrocytic ATP in the calorie restriction-induced antidepressant effect. Further experiments showed that systemic administration and local infusion of ATP into the mPFC induced an antidepressant effect, whereas decreasing ATP by Apyrase in the mPFC blocked calorie restriction-induced antidepressant regulation.

Elevated plus-maze and Lashley III Maze tests were used to evaluate anxiety and learning and memory, respectively. The hippocampal BAX, BCL-2, caspase3, caspase9 and heat-shock protein-70 (HSP-70) were evaluated by western blotting and oxidative stress markers including malondialdehyde (MDA), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), super oxide dismutase (SOD) as well as glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were evaluated by spectroscopy method. The serum was collected for the analysis of the corticosterone levels. Treatment with sericin in higher doses reversed anxiety-like behavior and cognitive deficit induced by HS. Moreover, heat exposure increased serum corticosterone, hippocampal MDA, apoptotic proteins and HSP-70 levels. Sericin administration decreased serum corticosterone and enhanced hippocampal antioxidant defense and attenuated apoptosis and HSP-70 levels. The results show that the protective effects of sericin against HS-mediated cognitive dysfunction and anxiety-like behavior is possibly through suppressing HSP-70, oxidative stress and apoptosis.\n", "authors": "Javad Mahmoudi,Leila Hosseini,Saeed Sadigh-Eteghad,Fereshteh Farajdokht,Seyed Mehdi Vatandoust,Mojtaba Ziaee", "pmid": "34089443", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:02.887Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:02.887Z", "publish_date": "2021-06-05", "keywords": "Apoptosis", "slug": "sericin-alleviates-thermal-stress-induced-anxiety-", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 1822, "fields": {"title": "Automatic cortical target point localisation in MRI for transcranial magnetic stimulation via a multi-resolution convolutional neural network.", "body": "\nTranscranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a growing therapy for a variety of psychiatric and neurological disorders that arise from or are modulated by cortical regions of the brain represented by singular 3D target points.

However, both approaches can be time-consuming which has an effect on the clinical workflow, and the latter does not take into account patient variability such as the varying number of cortical gyri where these targets are located.\nThis paper proposes a multi-resolution convolutional neural network for point localisation in MR images for a priori defined points in increasingly finely resolved versions of the input image. This approach is both fast and highly memory efficient, allowing it to run in high-throughput centres, and has the capability of distinguishing between patients with high levels of anatomical variability.\nPreliminary experiments have found the accuracy of this network to be [Formula: see text] mm, compared to [Formula: see text] mm for deformable registration and [Formula: see text] mm for a human expert. For most treatment points, the human expert and proposed CNN statistically significantly outperform registration, but neither statistically significantly outperforms the other, suggesting that the proposed network has human-level performance.\nThe human-level performance of this network indicates that it can improve TMS planning by automatically localising target points in seconds, avoiding more time-consuming registration or manual point localisation processes.

We found that GPR18 was expressed in meninges, hypothalamus, cortex and white matter before EBI. After SAH, GPR18 expression was increased in meninges and hypothalamus but decreased in cortex and white matter. RvD2 improved neurological scores and brain edema after SAH. RvD2 attenuated mast cell degranulation and reduced expression of chymase and tryptase expression in the meninges. In the hypothalamus, RvD2 attenuated inflammation, increased expression of proopiomelanocortin and interleukin-10, as well as decreased expression of nerve peptide Y and tumor necrosis factor-α. In cortex, RvD2 alleviated oxidative stress and apoptosis, and protected the blood-brain barrier. RvD2 also ameliorated white matter injury by elevating myelin basic protein and suppressing amyloid precursor protein.

Reversible (competitive) and irreversible (suicide) inhibitors of PRODH have been shown in vivo to inhibit cancer cell growth with excellent host tolerance. Surprisingly, the PRODH suicide inhibitor N-propargylglycine (N-PPG) also induces rapid decay of PRODH with concordant upregulation of mitochondrial chaperones (HSP-60, GRP-75) and the inner membrane protease YME1L1, signifying activation of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) independent of anticancer activity. The present study was undertaken to address two aims: (i) use PRODH overexpressing human cancer cells (ZR-75-1) to confirm the UPRmt inducing properties of N-PPG relative to another equipotent irreversible PRODH inhibitor, thiazolidine-2-carboxylate (T2C); and (ii) employ biochemical and transcriptomic approaches to determine if orally administered N-PPG can penetrate the blood-brain barrier, essential for its future use as a brain cancer therapeutic, and also potentially protect normal brain tissue by inducing mitohormesis. Oral daily treatments of N-PPG produced a dose-dependent decline in brain mitochondrial PRODH protein without detectable impairment in mouse health; furthermore, mice repeatedly dosed with 50 mg/kg N-PPG showed increased brain expression of the mitohormesis associated protease, YME1L1. Whole brain transcriptome (RNAseq) analyses of these mice revealed significant gene set enrichment in N-PPG stimulated neural processes (FDR p < 0.05).

Low CD4 nadir predicted additional hippocampal volume loss independent of depressive symptoms. Taking antidepressants did not have a detectable effect on hippocampal volume. In summary, having more depressive symptoms is associated with smaller hippocampal volume in PWH, and a history of severe immunosuppression (i.e., low CD4 nadir) correlates with additional hippocampal volume reduction.

We present their clinical and radiological features and compare these with the three adult siblings previously described with leukoencephalopathy and biallelic HMBS variants. All six affected individuals presented with slowly progressive spasticity, ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, with or without mild cognitive impairment, and/or ocular disease with onset in childhood or adolescence. Their brain MRIs show mainly confluent signal abnormalities in the periventricular and deep white matter and bilateral thalami. This recognizable pattern of MRI abnormalities is seen in all six adults described here. Biallelic variants in HMBS cause a phenotype that is distinct from AIP.

Many aspects of learning from reward resemble VSL in certain respects, yet whether and how reward learning impacts VSL is largely unexamined. In two studies, we found that reward contingencies affect VSL, with high-value associated with stronger behavioral and neural signatures of such learning than low-value images. In Experiment 1, participants learned values (high or low) of images through a trial-and-error risky choice task. Unbeknownst to them, images were paired as four types-High-High, High-Low, Low-High, and Low-Low. In subsequent recognition and reward memory tests, participants chose the more familiar of two pairs (a target and a foil) and recalled the value of images. We found better recognition when the first images of pairs have high-values, with High-High pairs showing the highest recognition rate. In Experiment 2, we provided evidence that both value and statistical contingencies affected brain responses. When we compared responses between the high-value first image and the low-value first image, greater activation in regions that included inferior frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate gyrus, hippocampus, among other regions, were found. These findings were driven by the interaction between statistically structured information and reward-the same value contrast yielded no regions for second-image contrasts and for singletons. Our results suggest that when reward information is embedded in stimulus-stimulus associations, it may alter the learning process; specifically, the higher-value first image potentially enables better memory for statistically learned pairs and reward information.\n", "authors": "Su Hyoun Park,Leeland L Rogers,Matthew R Johnson,Timothy J Vickery", "pmid": "34089142", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:02.933Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:02.933Z", "publish_date": "2021-06-04", "keywords": "Memory", "slug": "reward-impacts-visual-statistical-learning", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 1839, "fields": {"title": "DTI Atlases Evaluations.", "body": "\nThe cerebral atlas of diffusion tensor magnetic resonance image (DT-MRI, shorted as DTI) is one of the key issues in neuroimaging research. It is crucial for comparisons of neuronal structural integrity and connectivity across populations. Usually, the atlas is constructed by iteratively averaging the registered individual image. In tradition, the fuzzy group average image is easily generated in the initial stage, which is harmful to providing clear guidance for subsequent registration, to the performance of the final atlas. To solve this problem, an improved unbiased DTI atlas construction algorithm based on adaptive weights is proposed in this paper. The adaptive weighted strategy based on diffeomorphic deformable tensor registration is introduced. At the same time, the distance measure for tensors is used as a constraint condition, which ensures the unbiasedness of the atlas. Then, using 77 DTIs from the dataset in http://www.brain-development.org , three study-specific atlases, i.e. the constructed atlases of the proposed algorithm and two open-sourced algorithms (DTIAtlasBuilder and DTI-TK), are compared with two standardized atlases (IIT v. 4.1 and NTU-DSI-122-DTI). The performances of the atlases were evaluated in spatial normalization way with six region-based criteria (including Euclidean distances between diffusion tensors, Euclidean distances of the deviatoric tensors, standard deviation, overlaps of eigenvalue-eigenvector, cross-correlations and three sets angles of eigenvalue-eigenvector pairs between diffusion tensors) and three fiber-based criteria (including distances between fiber bundles, angles between fiber bundles and fiber property profile-based criteria). The experimental results showed that the overall performances of the study-specific atlases are better than those of the standardized atlases for specific datasets, and the comprehensive performance of the improved algorithm proposed in this paper is the best.\n", "authors": "Yi Wang,Maowen Xu,Lijun Geng,Yi Zhao,Zhe Guo,Yangyu Fan,Yilong Niu", "pmid": "34089139", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:02.935Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:02.935Z", "publish_date": "2021-06-04", "keywords": "Atlas", "slug": "dti-atlases-evaluations", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 1840, "fields": {"title": "Thalamocortical Spectral Transmission Relies on Balanced Input Strengths.", "body": "\nThe thalamus is a key element of sensory transmission in the brain, as it gates and selects sensory streams through a modulation of its internal activity. A preponderant role in these functions is played by its internal activity in the alpha range ([8-14] Hz), but the mechanism underlying this process is not completely understood. In particular, how do thalamocortical connections convey stimulus driven information selectively over the back-ground of thalamic internally generated activity? Here we investigate this issue with a spiking network model of feedforward connectivity between thalamus and primary sensory cortex reproducing the local field potential of both areas. We found that in a feedforward network, thalamic oscillations in the alpha range do not entrain cortical activity for two reasons: (i) alpha range oscillations are weaker in neurons projecting to the cortex, (ii) the gamma resonance dynamics of cortical networks hampers oscillations over the 10-20 Hz range thus weakening alpha range oscillations. This latter mechanism depends on the balance of the strength of thalamocortical connections toward excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the cortex. Our results highlight the relevance of corticothalamic feedback to sustain alpha range oscillations and pave the way toward an integrated understanding of the sensory streams traveling between the periphery and the cortex.\n", "authors": "Matteo Saponati,Jordi Garcia-Ojalvo,Enrico Cataldo,Alberto Mazzoni", "pmid": "34089121", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:02.938Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:02.938Z", "publish_date": "2021-06-04", "keywords": "Collective dynamics", "slug": "thalamocortical-spectral-transmission-relies-on-ba", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 1841, "fields": {"title": "Intra- and interhemispheric symmetry of subcortical brain structures: a volumetric analysis in the aging human brain.", "body": "\nHere, we address the hemispheric interdependency of subcortical structures in the aging human brain.

In addition, it is assumed that general neuronal excitability and responsiveness in early visual areas is to a great extent independent of feedback input originating in areas higher in the stream. Here, we review the contribution of feedback projections from MT, V4 and pulvinar to the receptive field properties of V2 neurons in the anesthetized and paralyzed monkey. Importantly, our results contradict both of these assumptions. We separately inactivated each of these three brain regions using GABA pressure injections, while simultaneously recording V2 single unit activity before and hours after inactivation. Recordings and GABA injections were carried out in topographically corresponding regions of the visual field. We outline the changes in V2 activity, responsiveness and receptive field properties for early, mid and late post-injection phases. Immediately after injection, V2 activity is globally suppressed. Subsequently, there is an increase in stimulus-driven relative to spontaneous neuronal activity, which improves the signal-to-noise coding for the oriented moving bars. Notably, V2 tuning properties change substantially relative to its pre-injection selectivity profile. The resulting increase or decrease in selectivity could not be readily predicted based on the selectivity profile of the inactivated site. Finally, V2 activity rebounds before returning to it pre-injection profile Our results show that feedback projections profoundly impact neuronal circuits in early visual areas, and may have been heretofore largely underestimated in their physiological role.\n", "authors": "A R A Correia,A K J Amorim,J G M Soares,B Lima,M Fiorani,R Gattass", "pmid": "34089102", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:02.944Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:02.944Z", "publish_date": "2021-06-04", "keywords": "Area V2", "slug": "the-role-of-feedback-projections-in-feature-tuning", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 1843, "fields": {"title": "Woven EndoBridge (WEB) Width at the Aneurysm Neck Level Affects Early Angiographic Aneurysm Occlusion.", "body": "\nEndovascular therapy with the Woven EndoBridge (WEB) device is a safe treatment approach, whereby neoendothelialization at the neck area is a crucial element for aneurysm occlusion.

We found that VLBW children showed atypical recruitment of emotional face processing networks in theta (4-7 Hz) compared to FT children.

Mutations in the FUS gene first identified in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) lead to the accumulation of the FUS protein in cytoplasmic inclusions. Here, we report that mutations in FUS lead to disruption of the transcriptional activity of FUS and mislocalization of U7 snRNA/snRNP in cytoplasmic aggregates in cellular models and primary neurons. As a consequence, decreased transcriptional efficiency and aberrant 3' end processing of histone pre-mRNAs were observed. This study highlights for the first time the deregulation of replication-dependent histone gene expression and its involvement in ALS.\n", "authors": "Ankur Gadgil,Agnieszka Walczak,Agata Stępień,Jonas Mechtersheimer,Agnes Lumi Nishimura,Christopher E Shaw,Marc-David Ruepp,Katarzyna Dorota Raczyńska", "pmid": "34088960", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:02.967Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:02.967Z", "publish_date": "2021-06-04", "keywords": "", "slug": "als-linked-fus-mutants-affect-the-localization-of-", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 1852, "fields": {"title": "The monoamine stabilizer OSU6162 has anxiolytic-like properties and reduces voluntary alcohol intake in a genetic rat model of depression.", "body": "\nAlcohol use disorders (AUD) often co-occur with anxiety and depressive disorders, and anxiety often drives relapse during alcohol abstinence.

To this end, we utilized a genetic rat model that exhibits increased anxiety- and depression-like behaviors (Flinders Sensitive Line; FSL) and their controls (Flinders Resistant Line; FRL).

To address this question, we had participants encode a motor sequence task in an initial test session, followed by brief task reactivations of only 30 s each, conducted on separate days. Learning was evaluated in a final retest session. The results showed that these brief reactivations induced significant motor skill learning gains. Nevertheless, the efficacy of reactivations was not consistent but determined by the number of consecutive correct sequences tapped during memory reactivations. Highly continuous reactivations resulted in higher learning gains, similar to those induced by full extensive practice, while lower continuity reactivations resulted in minimal learning gains. These results were replicated in a new independent sample of subjects, suggesting that the quality of memory reactivation, reflected by its continuity, regulates the magnitude of learning gains. In addition, the change in noninvasive brain stimulation measurements of corticospinal excitability evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation over primary motor cortex between pre- and postlearning correlated with retest and transfer performance.

The objective of the current research is to identify the neural mechanisms underlying the adaptive process. It has been shown previously that an increase in muscle co-contraction is frequently associated with the initial phase of adaptation and that co-contraction is gradually reduced as performance improves. Our investigation focused on the neural substrates of muscle co-contraction during the course of motor adaptation using a resting-state fMRI approach in healthy human subjects of both genders. We analyzed the functional connectivity in resting-state networks during three phases of adaptation, corresponding to different muscle co-contraction levels and found that change in the strength of functional connectivity in one brain network was correlated with a metric of co-contraction, and in another with a metric of motor learning. We identified the cerebellum as the key component for regulating muscle co-contraction, especially its connection to the inferior parietal lobule, which was particularly prominent in early stage adaptation. A neural link between cerebellum, superior frontal gyrus and motor cortical regions was associated with reduction of co-contraction during later stages of adaptation. We also found reliable changes in the functional connectivity of a network involving primary motor cortex, superior parietal lobule and cerebellum that were specifically related to the motor learning.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTIt is well known that co-contracting muscles is an effective strategy for providing postural stability by modulating mechanical impedance and thereby allowing the central nervous system to compensate for unfamiliar or unexpected physical conditions until motor commands can be appropriately adapted. The present study elucidates the neural substrates underlying the ability to modulate the mechanical impedance of a limb as we learn during motor adaptation. Using resting-state fMRI analysis we demonstrate that a distributed cerebellar-parietal-frontal network functions to regulate muscle co-contraction with the cerebellum as its key component.\nCopyright © 2021 the authors.\n", "authors": "Saeed Babadi,Shahabeddin Vahdat,Theodore E Milner", "pmid": "34088798", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:02.985Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:02.985Z", "publish_date": "2021-05-20", "keywords": "", "slug": "neural-substrates-of-muscle-co-contraction-during-", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 1859, "fields": {"title": "On the necessity of recurrent processing during object recognition: it depends on the need for scene segmentation.", "body": "\nWhile feed-forward activity may suffice for recognizing objects in isolation, additional visual operations that aid object recognition might be needed for real-world scenes. One such additional operation is figure-ground segmentation; extracting the relevant features and locations of the target object while ignoring irrelevant features. In this study of 60 human participants (female and male), we show objects on backgrounds of increasing complexity to investigate whether recurrent computations are increasingly important for segmenting objects from more complex backgrounds. Three lines of evidence show that recurrent processing is critical for recognition of objects embedded in complex scenes. First, behavioral results indicated a greater reduction in performance after masking objects presented on more complex backgrounds; with the degree of impairment increasing with increasing background complexity. Second, electroencephalography (EEG) measurements showed clear differences in the evoked response potentials (ERPs) between conditions around time points beyond feed-forward activity and exploratory object decoding analyses based on the EEG signal indicated later decoding onsets for objects embedded in more complex backgrounds. Third, Deep Convolutional Neural Network performance confirmed this interpretation; feed-forward and less deep networks showed a higher degree of impairment in recognition for objects in complex backgrounds compared to recurrent and deeper networks. Together, these results support the notion that recurrent computations drive figure-ground segmentation of objects in complex scenes.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe incredible speed of object recognition suggests that it relies purely on a fast feed-forward build-up of perceptual activity. However, this view is contradicted by studies showing that disruption of recurrent processing leads to decreased object recognition performance. Here we resolve this issue by showing that how object recognition is resolved, and whether recurrent processing is crucial, depends on the context in which it is presented. For objects presented in isolation or in 'simple' environments, feed-forward activity could be sufficient for successful object recognition. However, when the environment is more complex, additional processing seems necessary to select the elements that belong to the object, and by that segregate them from the background.\nCopyright © 2021 the authors.\n", "authors": "Noor Seijdel,Jessica Loke,Ron van de Klundert,Matthew van der Meer,Eva Quispel,Simon van Gaal,Edward H F de Haan,H Steven Scholte", "pmid": "34088797", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:02.988Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:02.988Z", "publish_date": "2021-06-02", "keywords": "", "slug": "on-the-necessity-of-recurrent-processing-during-ob", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 1860, "fields": {"title": "Reading-related brain changes in audiovisual processing: cross-sectional and longitudinal MEG evidence.", "body": "\nThe ability to establish associations between visual objects and speech sounds is essential for human reading.

To address these questions, the present longitudinal and cross-sectional MEG studies characterize the temporal and spatial neural correlates of audiovisual syllable congruency in children (4-9 years old, 22 males and 20 females) learning to read. Both studies showed that during the first years of reading instruction children gradually set up audiovisual correspondences between letters and speech sounds, which can be detected within the first 400 ms of a bimodal presentation and recruit the superior portions of the left temporal cortex.

However, the neural representations and coding characteristics of content and structure, particularly during WM maintenance, remain elusive. Here, in two electroencephalography (EEG) studies in human participants (both sexes), by transiently perturbing the 'activity-silent' WM retention state and decoding the reactivated WM information, we demonstrate that content and structure are stored in a dissociative manner with distinct characteristics throughout WM process. First, each tone in the sequence is associated with two codes in parallel, characterizing its frequency and ordinal position, respectively. Second, during retention, a structural retrocue successfully reactivates structure but not content, whereas a following white noise triggers content but not structure. Third, structure representation remains stable whereas content code undergoes a dynamic transformation through memory progress. Finally, the noise-triggered content reactivations during retention correlate with subsequent WM behavior. Overall, our results support distinct content and structure representations in auditory WM and provide an efficient approach to access the silently stored WM information in the human brain.

Neurons in the ventral MHb express acetylcholine along with glutamate, and both the MHb and IP are rich in nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Much of the work on this system has focused on nicotinic mechanisms and their clinical implications for nicotine use, particularly because the IP expresses the α5 nicotinic receptor subunit, encoded by the CHRNA5 gene, which is genetically linked to smoking risk. A working model has emerged in which nicotine use may be determined by the balance of reinforcement mediated in part by nicotine effects on dopamine reward pathways, and an aversive \"brake\" on nicotine consumption encoded in the MHb-IP pathway. However, recent work has proposed that the IP also receives direct dopaminergic input from the ventral tegmental area (VTA). If correct, this would significantly impact the prevailing model of IP function. Here we have used Chrna5Cre mice to perform rabies virus-mediated retrograde tracing of global inputs to the IP. We have also used Cre-dependent adeno-associated virus (AAV) anterograde tracing using Slc6a3Cre (DATCre ) mice to map VTA dopaminergic efferents, and we have examined tract-tracing data using other transgenic models for dopaminergic neurons available in a public database. Consistent with the existing literature using non-genetic tracing methods, none of these experiments show a significant anatomical connection from the VTA or substantia nigra to the IP, and thus do not support a model of direct dopaminergic input to the habenulopeduncular system.SIGNFICANCE STATEMENTThe interpeduncular nucleus is the central node in a descending brain pathway linking the medial habenula of the epithalamus to the mesopontine tegmentum. Neurons in this \"habenulopeduncular pathway\" express unusual nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and are thought to play a role in behavioral responses to nicotine. In particular, the IP expresses the α5 nicotinic receptor, human variants of which confer increased risk of smoking. Recently it has been reported that inputs from midbrain dopaminergic neurons to the IP also influence behavior. Here we have used a mouse genetic model to map specific inputs to the α5-expressing neurons in the IP.

We found that individuals with mutations in CHD8, among the highest-confidence autism risk genes, or CHD7 suffer from disturbed sleep maintenance. These defects are recapitulated in Drosophila mutants affecting kismet, the sole CHD8/CHD7 ortholog. We show that Kismet is required in glia for early developmental and adult sleep architecture. This role localizes to subperineurial glia constituting the blood-brain barrier. We demonstrate that Kismet-related sleep disturbances are caused by high serotonin during development, paralleling a well-established but genetically unsolved autism endophenotype. Despite their developmental origin, Kismet's sleep architecture defects can be reversed in adulthood by a behavioral regime resembling human sleep restriction therapy. Our findings provide fundamental insights into glial regulation of sleep and propose a causal mechanistic link between the CHD8/CHD7/Kismet family, developmental hyperserotonemia, and autism-associated sleep disturbances.\nCopyright © 2021 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Isolate of the capsular genotype K1, belonging to sequence type (ST) 23, is the most common causative agent of this disease. We experienced two cases of K1-ST23 infection with a travel history in East Asia, and hvKp infection was diagnosed after entering or returning to Japan. Case 1 was a 45-year-old Myanmar seaman with a history of ischemic heart disease who developed a fever on board and was transported to Japan via Shanghai and Taiwan. He had multiple disseminated lesions due to K. pneumoniae; other symptoms included liver abscess, intraocular inflammation, intraventricular thrombosis, brain abscess, and bloodstream infection. Along with antimicrobial treatment, drainage of liver abscesses and surgery for intraocular inflammation and intraventricular thrombosis were required. The patient was discharged 93 days after admission, with little improvement in the visual acuity. Case 2: A 29-year-old Japanese man with no underlying disease developed a prostate abscess and bloodstream infection caused by K. pneumoniae after a trip to Korea. However, he improved only with antimicrobial treatment. K. pneumoniae in both cases were identified to have the rmpA gene, with capsular genotypes K1 and ST23. Further, both cases were considered to have been infected with hvKp during their stay in East Asia. In conclusion, it is important to suspect disseminated disease and perform a systemic search, taking into account that hvKp may be present in cases of Klebsiella infection acquired from East Asia.\nCopyright © 2021 Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and The Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases.

Before and after 8 consecutive daily tDCS sessions over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), patients' cognitive performance was assessed using the Cambridge Brain Sciences-Cognitive Platform (CBS-CP). Cortical electrical activity was also evaluated using quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) analysis at baseline and after the intervention.\nCompared to the sham condition, significant improvement in reasoning and executive functions of the patients in the real tDCS group was observed. Attention was also improved considerably but not statistically significantly following real tDCS. However, no significant changes in resting-state brain activities were observed after stimulation in either group.\nAnodal tDCS over the left DLPFC appears to be a promising therapeutic option for cognitive dysfunction in patients with MS.

Pressure/volume overload, neurohumoral factors, cytokines, and ischemia enhance BNP gene expression, and then precursor proBNP is produced. It has been thought that proBNP is cleaved into active BNP molecule and inactive marker molecule NT-proBNP intracellularly by processing enzyme furin, and they are released into the circulation. However, recent studies have shown that considerable amount of uncleaved proBNP circulates in the blood. The commercially available BNP assay kits consist of two antibodies that sandwich the BNP molecule. Therefore, if proBNP is present, BNP assay kit cross-reacts to proBNP and measures it as BNP. Therefore, it should be noted that the current BNP value is proBNP plus BNP. BNP and NT-proBNP have been established as a biomarker for heart failure patients presenting dyspnea. But many pitfalls are present for interpreting the BNP value. For example, the presence of renal dysfunction, age, female sex, atrial fibrillation, inflammation, hyperthyroidism, use of sacubitril/valsartan, and macro-proBNPemia overestimate BNP value, whereas the presence of obesity, immediately after acute coronary syndrome onset, and pericardial effusion underestimate BNP value. In the management for heart failure patients, BNP plays an important role. Therefore, clinicians should note the pitfall of interpretation of BNP and we describe the mechanism involved.\nCopyright © 2021.

In this study, we carried out a systematic scoping review by synthesizing original studies on NMOSD from Africa.\nA comprehensive literature search of PubMed (MEDLINE), Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science databases with the search terms 'neuromyelitis optica' and 'Africa' was performed on June 17, 2020. Synthesis of the result was done using narrative analysis.\nOf the total 133 identified records, 14 eligible studies from Africa were included. Most of the studies were from North African countries (n = 8; 57%); predominantly retrospective descriptive (n = 8; 57%), or case series (n = 3; 21%); and published within the last two decades (n = 13; 93%).

During childhood, teaching seems to precede the emergence of several cognitive abilities, so the question arises: how does teaching affect the development of later emerging cognitive skills? Since teaching requires explicit, accessible representations of the knowledge of the teacher, we hypothesized that the motivation to teach might impact the way children encode novel information, by biasing them towards a model-based encoding, which can help them to structure the incoming information in a more abstract and explicitly accessible way. In our study, 7-10-year-old children were presented with a well-established probabilistic sequence learning task on two consecutive days, after receiving an instruction that on the second day, they would have to teach a peer about the task. During the task, we could simultaneously measure two different types of learning: model-free learning of local (lower-level) statistical correlations and model-based learning of the global (higher-level) statistical structures of the sequences. We predicted that in case the motivation to teach facilitates model-based encoding, children who received the instruction to teach would perform better in learning the higher-level statistical structures than children in the control group, who did not receive an instruction to teach. Furthermore, since previous studies showed competition between the two types of encoding processes during development, we also predicted that facilitating children's model-based learning will impair their model-free learning of the lower-level statistical correlations. Our results confirmed both predictions, showing an improved model-based higher-level structure learning and an impaired model-free lower-level statistical correlation learning in the Teaching Group, compared to the controls. Thus, prompting teaching affects children's encoding of the novel information, by biasing them to learn in a model-based way, which can help to build more abstract and explicitly accessible representations that could be shared with others.\nCopyright © 2021 The Author(s).

Therefore, there is a great need for mapping the snoRNome in different human tissues as the blueprint for snoRNA functions.\nWe used a low structure bias RNA-Seq approach to accurately quantify snoRNAs and compare them to the entire transcriptome in seven healthy human tissues (breast, ovary, prostate, testis, skeletal muscle, liver, and brain). We identify 475 expressed snoRNAs categorized in two abundance classes that differ significantly in their function, conservation level, and correlation with their host gene: 390 snoRNAs are uniformly expressed and 85 are enriched in the brain or reproductive tissues. Most tissue-enriched snoRNAs are embedded in lncRNAs and display strong correlation of abundance with them, whereas uniformly expressed snoRNAs are mostly embedded in protein-coding host genes and are mainly non- or anticorrelated with them.

The neuroprotective effect of melatonin is well known, but the effect of its interaction with lead in the brain remains inconclusive.\nTo assess the therapeutic role of melatonin on cognitive deficit, anxiety and depressive-like symptoms in matured male Wistar rats exposed to a subchronic lead chloride (PbCl2 ).\nTwenty male Wistar rats were blindly randomized into four groups (n = 5/group): group 1 to 4 underwent intragastric administration of physiological saline (10 ml/kg; vehicle), PbCl2 (50 mg/kg), melatonin (10 mg/kg) and PbCl2 + melatonin respectively for a period of 4 weeks during which neurobehavioral data were extracted, followed by neurochemical and histopathological evaluations.\nExposure to PbCl2 reduced cognitive performance by increasing the escape latency and average proximity to the platform zone border, decreasing average path length in the platform zone, cognitive score, and time spent in probing. It raised the thigmotaxis percentage, time spent in rearing, number of pellet-like feces, and time spent in the dark compartment of a bright/dark box which are predictors of anxiety. It also induced depressive-like behavior as immobility time was enhanced. PbCl2 deranged neurochemicals; malondialdehyde, interlukin-1β, and tumor necrotic factor-α were increased while superoxide dismutase and acetylcholinesterase were decreased without remarkable alteration in reduced glutathione and nitric oxide. Administration of PbCl2 further disrupted neuronal settings of hippocampal proper and dentate gyrus. In contrast, the supplementation of melatonin reversed all the neurological consequences of PbCl2 neurotoxicity by eliciting its properties against oxidative and nonoxidative action of PbCl2 .\nThese findings suggest that melatonin down-regulates neurotoxicant interplays in the brain systems. Therefore, this study suggests the use of melatonin as an adjuvant therapy in neuropathological disorders/dysfunctions.\n© 2021 The Authors.

Finally, we conducted gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to explore the potential mechanisms.Data from the TCGA database showed that EFNA1 was differentially expressed in many kinds of cancers when compared with normal tissues. Upregulated EFNA1 expression in esophageal carcinoma (ESCA), cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma (CESC), and LGG correlated with shorter patient overall survival (OS) times. The Cox regression analysis revealed that the expression of EFNA1 was also a risk factor for the disease-specific survival (DSS) and progression-free interval (PFI) of LGG patients. The multiple Cox regression analysis revealed that EFNA1 was an independent prognostic factor for LGG patients. In addition, EFNA1 expression was increased in the WHO grade III group and the 1p19q non-codeletion group. Moreover, EFNA1 expression was positively correlated with the levels of infiltrating CD4+ T cells, myeloid dendritic cells and neutrophils in LGG. GSEA suggested that several GO and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) items associated with nervous system function and apoptotic pathway were significantly enriched in the EFNA1-low and EFNA1-high expression phenotypes.EFNA1 may play a pivotal role in the development of LGG and may serve as a potential marker for LGG prognosis and therapy.\nCopyright © 2021 the Author(s).

Leptin resistance that develops in brain and also directly in peripheral tissues is considered as central and peripheral leptin resistance, respectively. The mechanism of central leptin resistance is the focus of intensive studies but still not totally clarified. A challenged notion about the effect of impaired leptin BBB transport emerges and a concept of \"selective leptin resistance\" is discussed. Peripheral leptin resistance, especially leptin resistance in muscle, has drawn more attention recently, while its mechanism remains unclear. Exercise is an effective way to reduce obesity, which is at least in part due to the alleviation of leptin resistance.

Surgical response was defined as ≥ 75% pain relief 1 year post-treatment. We created two prediction models using pre-treatment regional brain gray matter morphology (cortical thickness or surface area) to distinguish responders from non-responders to radiosurgery. Feature selection was performed through sequential backwards selection algorithm. Model out-of-sample generalizability was estimated via stratified 10-fold cross-validation procedure and permutation testing.\nIn 51 trigeminal neuralgia patients (35 responders, 16 non-responders), machine learning models based on pre-treatment regional brain gray matter morphology (14 regional surface areas or 13 regional cortical thicknesses) provided robust a priori prediction of surgical response. Cross-validation revealed the regional surface area model was 96.7% accurate, 100.0% sensitive, and 89.1% specific while the regional cortical thickness model was 90.5% accurate, 93.5% sensitive, and 83.7% specific. Permutation testing revealed that both models performed beyond pure chance (p < 0.001). The best predictor for regional surface area model and regional cortical thickness model was contralateral superior frontal gyrus and contralateral isthmus cingulate gyrus, respectively.\nOur findings support the use of machine learning techniques in subsequent investigations of chronic neuropathic pain.

In addition, using electroencephalography (EEG), we examined the effects on the P3 and the Late Positive Potential (LPP) of the Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) in reaction to situations that depict victims of aggression.\nFifty male forensic patients with a substance dependence were tested in a double-blind sham-controlled randomized study. The patients received HD-tDCS two times a day for 20 min for five consecutive days. Before and after the intervention, the patients completed self-reports, performed the Point Subtraction Aggression Paradigm (PSAP), and EEG was recorded while patients performed an empathy task.\nResults showed a decrease in aggressive responses on the PSAP and in self-reported reactive aggression in the active tDCS group. Additionally, we found a general increase in LPP amplitude after active tDCS. No effects on trait empathy and the P3 were found.\nCurrent findings are the first to find positive effects of HD-tDCS reducing aggression and modulate electrophysiological responses in forensic patients, showing the potential of using tDCS as an intervention to reduce aggression in forensic mental healthcare.\nCopyright © 2021.

Increasing load has been shown to dampen its performance and affect oscillatory neural activity in different frequency bands. Nevertheless, mixed results regarding fast frequencies activity and a lack of research on WM load modulations of cross-frequency phase-amplitude coupling mechanisms preclude a better understanding of the impact of increased WM load levels on brain activity as well as inter-regional communication and coordination supporting WM processes. Hence, we analyzed the EEG activity of 25 participants while performing a delayed-matching-to-sample (DMS) WM task with three WM load levels. Current density power and distribution at the source level for theta, beta, and gamma frequencies during the task's delay period were compared for each pair of WM load conditions. Results showed maximal increases of theta activity in frontal areas and of fast frequencies' activity in posterior regions with WM load, showing the involvement of frontal theta activity in WM maintenance and the control of attentional resources and visual processing by beta and gamma activity. To study whether WM load modulates communication between cortical areas, posterior beta and gamma amplitudes distribution across frontal theta phase was also analysed for those areas showing the largest significant WM load modulations. Higher beta activity amplitude at bilateral cuneus and right middle occipital gyrus, and higher gamma activity amplitude at bilateral posterior cingulate were observed during frontal theta phase peak in low than high memory load conditions. Moreover, greater fast beta amplitude at the right postcentral gyrus was observed during theta phase trough at right middle frontal gyrus in high than low memory load conditions. These results show that WM load modulates whether interregional communication occurs during theoretically optimal or non-optimal time windows, depending on the demands of frontal control of posterior areas required to perform the task successfully.\nCopyright © 2021.

Among the organs of the human body, the brain possesses a relatively low regenerative capacity and could retain perturbations established as a result of developmental obesity. Calorie restriction (CR) or a restricted ketogenic diet (KD) are successfully used as weight loss approaches, but their impact on obesity-related effects in the brain have not been previously evaluated.\nWe performed a series of experiments in a rat model of developmental obesity induced by a 12-week cafeteria diet, followed by CR to implement weight loss. First, we assessed the impact of obesity on neurogenesis (BrdU incorporation into the hippocampus), cognitive function (water maze), and concomitant changes in hippocampal protein expression (GC/MS-MS, western blot). Next, we repeated these experiments in a rat model of weight loss induced by CR. We also measured mitochondrial enzyme activity in rats after weight loss during the fed or fasting state. This study was extended by additional experiments with restricted KD used as a weight loss approach in order to compare the efficacy of two different nutritional interventions used in the treatment of obesity on hippocampal functions. By using a modified version of the water maze we evaluated cognitive abilities in rats subjected to weight loss by CR or a restricted KD.\nIn this study, obesity affected metabolic processes, upregulated hippocampal NF-κB, and induced proteomic differences which were associated with impaired cognition and neurogenesis. Weight loss improved neurogenesis and enhanced cognition. While the expression pattern of some proteins persisted after weight loss, most of the changes appeared de novo revealing metabolic adjustment by overactivation of citrate synthase and downregulation of ATP synthase. As a consequence of fasting, the activity of these enzymes indicated hippocampal adaptation to negative energy balance during the weight loss phase of CR. Moreover, the effects on cognitive abilities measured after weight loss were negatively correlated with the animal weight measured at the final stage of weight gain. This was alleviated by KD, which improved cognition when used as a weight loss approach.\nThe study shows that cognition and mitochondrial metabolism in the hippocampus are affected by CR- or KD-induced weight loss.\nCopyright © 2021.

CCT subunits, particularly CCT2, were increased in breast cancer cells and this correlated with tumor progression. Experimental induction of CCT2 increase was accompanied by an increase of CCT3, 4, and 5, providing another evidence for the interconnection between the members of the CS and the difficulties expected while manipulating one member with therapeutic purposes. Another in silico study demonstrated a direct correlation between the increase in the tumor tissue of the mRNA levels of all CCT subunits, except CCTB6, with bad prognosis.

Yet, the exact role of nicotiflorin in cerebral I/R injury is uncharacterized and the possible mechanisms have not been clearly expounded.\nThe present study was designed to determine the effect of nicotiflorin on cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and its relationship with autophagy.\nMiddle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats and oxygen-glucose deprivation and reintroduction (OGD/R) in SH-SY5Y cells were established in in vivo and in vitro models, respectively. The severity of MCAO was assessed by brain infarct size, neurological scores and survival rate. The severity of OGD/R was evaluated by cell viability, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and cell apoptosis. The level of autophagy was evaluated both in vivo and in vitro. Autophagosomes were observed using transmission electron microscopy and autophagic flux was measured using mRFP-GFP-tandem fluorescent LC3 adenovirus. Autophagy-related proteins (LC3-II/I, SQSTM1, beclin-1, Phospho-mTOR/mTOR) were measured by immunoblot. Autophagy-related mRNA levels (Becn1, Atg7) were detected by Real-Time PCR. Inhibition of autophagy was implemented by 3-Methyladenine (3-MA) or chloroquine in vitro.\nIn vivo, nicotiflorin treatment alleviated brain damage and neurological deficit while it dramatically increased 72 h survival rate in rats. In vitro, nicotiflorin treatment also ameliorated the severity of OGD/R. Moreover, nicotiflorin treatment increased ischemic penumbra autophagy (autophagosomes, BECN1, LC3-II/I ratio, SQSTM1, Phospho-mTOR/mTOR, Atg7). In vitro, nicotiflorin likewise enhanced autophagy and promoted autophagy flux. Furthermore, the blockade of autophagy by 3-MA or chloroquine disabled the efficacic of nicotiflorin in preventing cell damage upon OGD/R insult.\nThese findings suggest that autophagy plays a significant role in the protective effect of nicotiflorin against ischemic stroke.\nCopyright © 2021.

An essential trace element, iron is abundant within the brain and involved in many fundamental neurobiological processes, including oxygen transportation, oxidative phosphorylation, myelin production and maintenance, as well as neurotransmitter synthesis and metabolism. Excessive levels of iron are neurotoxic and thus iron homeostasis is tightly regulated in the brain, however, many details about the mechanisms by which this is achieved are yet to be elucidated. A key mediator of oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammatory response, iron dysregulation is an important contributor to secondary injury in TBI. Advances in neuroimaging that leverage magnetic susceptibility properties have enabled increasingly comprehensive investigations into the distribution and behaviour of iron in the brain amongst healthy individuals as well as disease states such as TBI. Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) is an advanced neuroimaging technique that promises quantitative estimation of local magnetic susceptibility at the voxel level. In this review, we provide an overview of brain iron and its homeostasis, describe recent advances enabling applications of QSM within the context of TBI and summarise the current state of the literature. Although limited, the emergent research suggests that QSM is a promising neuroimaging technique that can be used to investigate a host of pathophysiological changes that are associated with TBI.\nCopyright © 2021 IBRO.

Reduced precision (i.e., imprecision) results from the presence of neural noise at each level of sensory, motor, and perceptual processing. This review has three objectives: 1) to show the importance of studying vestibular precision, and specifically that studying accuracy without studying precision ignores fundamental aspects of the vestibular system; 2) to synthesize key hypotheses about precision in vestibular perception, the vestibulo-ocular reflex, posture, and neurons; and 3) to show that groups of studies that are thoughts to be distinct (e.g., perceptual thresholds, subjective visual vertical variability, neuronal variability) are actually \"two sides of the same coin\" - because the methods used allow results to be related to the standard deviation of a Gaussian distribution describing the underlying neural noise. Vestibular precision varies with age, stimulus amplitude, stimulus frequency, body orientation, motion direction, pathology, medication, and electrical/mechanical vestibular stimulation, but does not vary with sex. The brain optimizes precision during integration of vestibular cues with visual, auditory, and/or somatosensory cues. Since a common concern with precision metrics is time required for testing, we describe approaches to optimize data collection and provide evidence that fatigue and session effects are minimal. Finally, we summarize how precision is an individual trait that is correlated with clinical outcomes in patients as well as with performance in functional tasks like balance. These findings highlight the importance of studying vestibular precision and accuracy, and that knowledge gaps remain.\nCopyright © 2021.

SAR treatment for a week, starting the first dose (25 mg/kg, oral) 4 h after the onset of SE, significantly reduced spontaneously recurring seizures and epileptiform spikes during the four months of continuous video-EEG monitoring. Immunohistochemistry of brain sections and Western blot analyses of hippocampal lysates at 8-day (8d) and 4-month post-SE revealed a significant reduction of SE-induced astrogliosis, microgliosis, neurodegeneration, phosphorylated Fyn/Src-419 and PKCδ-tyr311, in SAR-treated group when compared with the vehicle control. We also found the suppression of nitroxidative stress markers such as iNOS, 3-NT, 4-HNE, and gp91phox in the hippocampus, and nitrite and ROS levels in the serum of the SAR-treated group at 8d post-SE. The qRT-PCR (hippocampus) and ELISA (serum) revealed a significant reduction of key proinflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL-1β mRNA in the hippocampus and their protein levels in serum, in addition to IL-6 and IL-12, in the SAR-treated group at 8d in contrast to the vehicle-treated group. These findings suggest that SAR targets some of the key biomarkers of epileptogenesis and modulates neuroinflammatory and nitroxidative pathways that mediate the development of epilepsy. Therefore, SAR can be developed as a potential disease-modifying agent to prevent the development and progression of TLE.\nCopyright © 2018.

Due to the progressive aging of the population, AD is becoming a healthcare burden of unprecedented proportions. Twenty years ago, it was reported that some indole molecules produced by the gut microbiota possess essential biological activities, including neuroprotection and antioxidant properties. Since then, research has cemented additional characteristics of these substances, including anti-inflammatory, immunoregulatory, and amyloid anti-aggregation features. Herein, we summarize the evidence supporting an integrated hypothesis that some of these substances can influence the age of onset and progression of AD and are central to the symbiotic relationship between intestinal microbes and the brain. Studies have shown that some of these substances' activities result from interactions with biologically conserved pathways and with genetic risk factors for AD. By targeting multiple pathologic mechanisms simultaneously, certain indoles may be excellent candidates to ameliorate neurodegeneration. We propose that management of the microbiota to induce a higher production of neuroprotective indoles (e.g., indole propionic acid) will promote brain health during aging. This area of research represents a new therapeutic paradigm that could add functional years of life to individuals who would otherwise develop dementia.\nCopyright © 2018.

At the macroscale, its structural and functional interpretation is conventionally assessed at the level of cortical units. However, the definition and validation of such cortical parcellations are problematic due to the absence of a true gold standard. We propose a framework for quantitative evaluation of brain parcellations via statistical prediction of connectomics data. Specifically, we evaluate the extent in which the network representation at the level of cortical units (defined as parcels) accounts for high-resolution brain connectivity. Herein, we assess the pertinence and comparative ranking of ten existing parcellation atlases to account for functional (FC) and structural connectivity (SC) data based on data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP), and compare them to data-driven as well as spatially-homogeneous geometric parcellations including geodesic parcellations with similar size distributions as the atlases. We find substantial discrepancy in parcellation structures that well characterize FC and SC and differences in what well represents an individual's functional connectome when compared against the FC structure that is preserved across individuals. Surprisingly, simple spatial homogenous parcellations generally provide good representations of both FC and SC, but are inferior when their within-parcellation distribution of individual parcel sizes is matched to that of a valid atlas. This suggests that the choice of fine grained and coarse representations used by existing atlases are important. However, we find that resolution is more critical than the exact border location of parcels.\nCopyright © 2021.

As the core nodes of emotion-related brain circuitry, the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and centromedial amygdala (CMA) as two major amygdalar nuclei, are recognized to play distinct roles in affective functions and internal states, via their unique connections with cortical and subcortical structures in rodents. However, little is known how the dynamical organization of emotion-related brain circuitry reflects internal autonomic responses in humans. Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with K-means clustering approach in a total of 79 young healthy individuals (cohort 1: 42; cohort 2: 37), we identified two distinct states of BLA- and CMA-based intrinsic connectivity patterns, with one state (integration) showing generally stronger BLA- and CMA-based intrinsic connectivity with multiple brain networks, while the other (segregation) exhibiting weaker yet dissociable connectivity patterns. In an independent cohort 2 of fMRI data with concurrent recording of skin conductance, we replicated two similar dynamic states and further found higher skin conductance level in the integration than segregation state. Moreover, machine learning-based Elastic-net regression analyses revealed that time-varying BLA and CMA intrinsic connectivity with distinct network configurations yield higher predictive values for spontaneous fluctuations of skin conductance level in the integration than segregation state.

Recent studies have employed 'fingerprinting' analyses on functional connectivity to identify subjects' idiosyncratic features. Here, we develop a complementary approach based on an edge-centric model of functional connectivity, which focuses on the co-fluctuations of edges. We first show whole-brain edge functional connectivity (eFC) to be a robust substrate that improves identifiability over nodal FC (nFC) across different datasets and parcellations. Next, we characterized subjects' identifiability at different spatial scales, from single nodes to the level of functional systems and clusters using k-means clustering. Across spatial scales, we find that heteromodal brain regions exhibit consistently greater identifiability than unimodal, sensorimotor, and limbic regions. Lastly, we show that identifiability can be further improved by reconstructing eFC using specific subsets of its principal components. In summary, our results highlight the utility of the edge-centric network model for capturing meaningful subject-specific features and sets the stage for future investigations into individual differences using edge-centric models.\nCopyright © 2021 The Author(s).

Once thought to be a myth, paternal exposure to insults leading to numerous detrimental effects in the offspring, has been confirmed on several occasions and is gaining increased attention. These effects could be demonstrated molecularly, biochemically and/or behaviorally. Different epigenetic mechanisms have been proposed for these effects to occur, including DNA methylation, histone modification and sperm RNA transmission. Paternal insult exposure has been shown to cause several neurobehavioral and developmental defects in the offspring. Findings on parental insult exposure effects on the progeny will be discussed in this review, with the main focus being on neurobehavioral effects after parental preconceptional exposure. The exposure to the insults induced long-lasting, mostly marked, defects. A few pioneering, prevention and reversal studies were published. Interestingly, most studies were conducted on paternal exposure and, at the present state of this field, on animal models. Clinical translation remains the subsequent challenge.\nCopyright © 2021.

However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying SD-associated depression and anxiety remain elusive. Does the neuroinflammation play a role in mediating the effects of SD? In this study, we investigated SD-induced cellular and molecular alterations in the hippocampus and asked whether treatment with an anti-inflammatory drug, minocycline, could attenuate these alterations. We found that SD animals exhibit activated microglia and decreased levels of Keap1 and Nrf2 (antioxidant and anti-inflammatory factors) in the hippocampus. In vivo local field potential recordings show decreased theta and beta oscillations, but increased high gamma oscillations, as a result of SD. Behavioral analysis revealed increased immobility time in the forced swim and tail suspension tests, and decreased sucrose intake in SD mice, all indicative of depressive-like behavior. Moreover, open field test and elevated plus maze test results indicated that SD increases anxiety-like behavior. Interestingly, treatment with the microglial modulator minocycline prevented SD-induced microglial activation, restored Keap1 and Nrf2 levels, normalized neuronal oscillations, and alleviated depressive-like and anxiety-like behavior. The present study reveals that microglial activation and Keap1-Nrf2 signaling play a crucial role in SD-induced behavioral alteration, and that minocycline treatment has a protective effect on these alterations.\nCopyright © 2021.

Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying the immune responses to teleost BAD bacterial infection and mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis remains unclear. In order to elucidate the mechanisms involved, in this study, a Ctenopharyngodon idella (grass carp) BAD gene named GcBAD1 was firstly cloned and characterized. The results indicated that the ORF (open reading frame) of GcBAD1 was 438 bp in length, encoding a 145-amino acid putative protein of 16.66 kDa. This deduced amino acid sequence has a better identity than another teleost species according to a phylogenetic analysis, and contains a Bcl2-BAD-1 domain. In healthy grass carp fish, the mRNA transcripts of GcBAD1 were widely present in the studied tissues, which could be ranked as follows; spleen > brain > middle-kidney > head-kidney > liver > gills > intestines > heart and muscle. In addition, during infection by Aeromonas hydrophila and Staphylococcus aureus, the mRNA transcription and protein levels expression of GcBAD1 in the head-kidney, spleen, and liver tissues of the fish were significantly up-regulated. Moreover, when the C. idellus kidney cell line (CIK) cells were incubated with Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and lipoteichoic acid (LTA), the GcBAD1 expression transcripts were also significantly up-regulated. Additionally, overexpression of GcBAD1 in CIK cells was able to activate apoptosis-related genes, including those encoding p53, Cytochrome C (CytoC), caspase-3, and caspase-9. Besides, in the TUNEL assays, when pEGFP-BAD1 was over-expressed, the number of red signals associated with apoptosis were significantly increased in the CIK cells infected with LPS or LTA at 12 h. This study demonstrates that GcBAD1 has a significant role in the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway of grass carp's innate immunity. Our findings provide new insight into the potential mechanisms of teleost antibacterial immunity.\nCopyright © 2021.

Sleep deprivation (SD) could lead to memory deficits, and it was a candidate risk factor for AD. However, the effects of chronic SD on the cognitive functions of AD model mice and its possible mechanism are still unclear. In the present study, 8-month-old male APP/PS1 transgenic mice and wild type (WT) littermates were subjected to chronic SD by using the modified multiple platform method (MMPM), with 20 hours of SD each day for 21 days. Then, the effects of chronic SD on cognitive functions in APP/PS1 mice were tested by using behavioral tests, the potential mechanisms were investigated by in vivo electrophysiological recording, western blot and immunochemistry. The results showed that chronic SD obviously aggravated the cognitive impairments, exacerbated in vivo hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) suppression, reduced the expression level of PSD95, increased amyloid-β (Aβ) protein deposition and overactivated microglia in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. These results indicate that chronic SD exacerbates the cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 mice by accelerating the development of AD pathologies, reducing the expression of PSD95 and aggravating the LTP suppression in hippocampus. At the same time, chronic SD also impaired cognitive functions and synaptic plasticity in WT mice through down-regulating the level of PSD95 and activating microglia. These findings further clarify the electrophysiological and molecular mechanisms of exacerbated cognitive deficits in AD caused by chronic SD.\nCopyright © 2021.

To solve these problems, we designed and synthesized a multi - strategy peptide (MOP), an ingenious apolipoprotein E mimetic peptide, which could reduce Aβ deposition via inhibiting Aβ aggregation and at the same time accelerate Aβ clearance. Meanwhile, MOP could be self-assembled into different nanostructure, thus we constructed a multifunctional delivery system (APND-3) based on MOP self-assembled nanorods (aspect ratios of 3) that was a favorable morphology to enhance the permeation across the blood brain barrier (BBB) to address the poor delivery to brain issues. Besides, the drug delivery system introduces polydopamine (PDA) and COG1410 ligand as a shell to keep the favorable morphology of core and enhance the BBB targeting efficiency. As a result, the delivery system significantly enhances the delivery of MOP to the brain, thus reducing Aβ deposition, mitigating the memory deficits, and ameliorating neurologic damage in AD model mice. Our findings suggest that our drug and carrier integrated multifunctional delivery system has the potential for AD treatment.\nCopyright © 2021.

These prodrugs showed significantly improved solubility and cellular uptake, which were primarily driven by putative pyrilamine cationic transporters. They also displayed more efficient brain delivery in vivo, reaching as high as 21.5-fold brain accumulation increase compared with NBP, leading to much higher bioavailability and stronger therapeutic effects. The toxicity of these molecules is also lower or similar to that of unmodified NBP. We showed that the tertiary amino group-modified NBP prodrugs are effective and safe for treating ischemic stroke with significantly enhanced druggability; hence, they have potential for further clinical development.\nCopyright © 2021.

Regular exercise mitigates the progression of these metabolic problems and contributes positively to memory and behavior. Therefore, public health agencies have incorporated exercise in the treatment of widespread disorders. The hypothalamus, specifically the ventromedial and the arcuate nuclei, responds to exercise activity and modulates energy metabolism through stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system and catecholamine secretion into the circulation. In addition, physical performance enhances cognitive functions and memory, mediated mostly by an increase in brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels in brain. During exercise training, skeletal muscle myofibers remodel their biochemical, morphological and physiological state. Moreover, skeletal muscle interacts with other organs by the release into the circulation of myokines, molecules that exhibit autocrine, paracrine and endocrine functions. Several studies have focused on the role of skeletal muscle and tissues in response to physical activity. However, how the hypothalamus could influence the skeletal muscle task in the context of exercise is less studied. Here, we review recent data about hypothalamus-skeletal muscle crosstalk in response to physical activity and focus on specific aspects such as the neuroendocrinological effects of exercise and the endocrine functions of skeletal muscle, to provide a perspective for future study directions.\nCopyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we elucidate an intrinsic energetic repair signaling axis that boosts axonal energy supply by reprogramming mitochondrial trafficking and anchoring in response to acute injury-ischemic stress in mature neurons and adult brains. P21-activated kinase 5 (PAK5) is a brain mitochondrial kinase with declined expression in mature neurons. PAK5 synthesis and signaling is spatiotemporally activated within axons in response to ischemic stress and axonal injury. PAK5 signaling remobilizes and replaces damaged mitochondria via the phosphorylation switch that turns off the axonal mitochondrial anchor syntaphilin. Injury-ischemic insults trigger AKT growth signaling that activates PAK5 and boosts local energy supply, thus protecting axon survival and facilitating regeneration in in vitro and in vivo models. Our study reveals an axonal mitochondrial signaling axis that responds to injury and ischemia by remobilizing damaged mitochondria for replacement, thereby maintaining local energy supply to support central nervous system (CNS) survival and regeneration.\nPublished by Elsevier Inc.\n", "authors": "Ning Huang,Sunan Li,Yuxiang Xie,Qi Han,Xiao-Ming Xu,Zu-Hang Sheng", "pmid": "34087103", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:03.206Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:03.206Z", "publish_date": "2021-05-26", "keywords": "AKT", "slug": "reprogramming-an-energetic-akt-pak5-axis-boosts-ax", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 1939, "fields": {"title": "The International Brain Bee: Cultivating the next generation of neuroscientists.", "body": "\nBrain Bees are neuroscience competitions for teenagers (age 13 through 19) hosted around the world.

Recent studies have accentuated concerns about whether certain prescribed medications could increase risk of dementia, including anticholinergic drugs, and specifically anticholinergics used for bladder symptoms. Nevertheless, it can be difficult to draw together the evidence to review the case for possible causation. Recognising this issue in 1965, Bradford-Hill set out nine criteria to help assess whether evidence of a causal relationship could be inferred between a presumed cause and an observed effect. In this commentary, we explore the extent to which associations between anticholinergics and dementia satisfy the Bradford-Hill criteria and examine the potential implications. First, we look at studies that have examined the relationship between anticholinergic drugs with urological properties (bladder drugs) and the onset of dementia, and then present those studies which specifically focus on the cognitive effects of bladder drugs that affect muscarinic receptors in the brain versus the bladder on older people along with suggestions for future research. We also discuss the risks and benefits of these drugs for treating overactive bladder. If it can be shown that certain medications carry a specific risk of dementia, it is possible that initiatives to change prescribing could become a key tool in reducing the risk of dementia and may be easier to implement than some lifestyle changes.\n© 2021 The Authors.

De novo variants of CCND2 clustering in the distal part of the protein have been identified as pathogenic causes of brain overgrowth (megalencephaly, MEG) and severe cortical malformations in children including the megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-polydactyly-hydrocephalus (MPPH) syndrome. Megalencephaly-associated CCND2 variants are localized to the terminal exon and result in accumulation of degradation-resistant protein. We identified five individuals from three unrelated families with novel variants in the proximal region of CCND2 associated with microcephaly, mildly simplified cortical gyral pattern, symmetric short stature, and mild developmental delay. Identified variants include de novo frameshift variants and a dominantly inherited stop-gain variant segregating with the phenotype. This is the first reported association between proximal CCND2 variants and microcephaly, to our knowledge. This series expands the phenotypic spectrum of CCND2-related disorders and suggests that distinct classes of CCND2 variants are associated with reciprocal effects on human brain growth (microcephaly and megalencephaly due to possible loss or gain of protein function, respectively), adding to the growing paradigm of inverse phenotypes due to dysregulation of key brain growth genes.\n© 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.\n", "authors": "Filomena Pirozzi,Benson Lee,Nicole Horsley,Deepika D Burkardt,William B Dobyns,John M Graham,Maria L Dentici,Claudia Cesario,Jens Schallner,Joseph Porrmann,Nataliya Di Donato,Pedro A Sanchez-Lara,Ghayda M Mirzaa", "pmid": "34087052", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:03.216Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:03.216Z", "publish_date": "2021-06-04", "keywords": "cyclin D2", "slug": "proximal-variants-in-ccnd2-associated-with-microce", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 1943, "fields": {"title": "Corrigendum.", "body": "", "authors": "", "pmid": "34087051", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:03.219Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:03.219Z", "publish_date": "2021-04-06", "keywords": "", "slug": "corrigendum", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 1944, "fields": {"title": "Motor and higher-order functions topography of the human dentate nuclei identified with tractography and clustering methods.", "body": "\nDeep gray matter nuclei are the synaptic relays, responsible to route signals between specific brain areas. Dentate nuclei (DNs) represent the main output channel of the cerebellum and yet are often unexplored especially in humans. We developed a multimodal MRI approach to identify DNs topography on the basis of their connectivity as well as their microstructural features. Based on results, we defined DN parcellations deputed to motor and to higher-order functions in humans in vivo. Whole-brain probabilistic tractography was performed on 25 healthy subjects from the Human Connectome Project to infer DN parcellations based on their connectivity with either the cerebral or the cerebellar cortex, in turn. A third DN atlas was created inputting microstructural diffusion-derived metrics in an unsupervised fuzzy c-means classification algorithm. All analyses were performed in native space, with probability atlas maps generated in standard space. Cerebellar lobule-specific connectivity identified one motor parcellation, accounting for about 30% of the DN volume, and two non-motor parcellations, one cognitive and one sensory, which occupied the remaining volume. The other two approaches provided overlapping results in terms of geometrical distribution with those identified with cerebellar lobule-specific connectivity, although with some differences in volumes. A gender effect was observed with respect to motor areas and higher-order function representations. This is the first study that indicates that more than half of the DN volumes is involved in non-motor functions and that connectivity-based and microstructure-based atlases provide complementary information.

This study explored the association between maternal sensitivity when infants (N = 24) were 7 months old and their patterns of cortical activation to touch at 12 months.

Changes in oxy (HbO2)- and deoxy (HHb)-hemoglobin concentrations were measured in the left somatosensory cortex and right temporal cortex while infants received two types of tactile stimulation - affective and discriminative touch. Results showed that lower maternal sensitivity was associated with a higher HbO2 response for discriminative touch over the temporal region. Additionally, infants of less sensitive mothers tended to present a higher response in HbO2 for affective touch over the somatosensory region.

Methylphenidate has two chiral centers; however, d-threo-methylphenidate is responsible for its effects. Few studies have analyzed methylphenidate and its metabolites, ritalinic acid and ethylphenidate, in blood. Stability studies are crucial in a forensic setting to provide insight on ideal storage conditions and analysis time. In this study, d,l-methylphenidate, d,l-ethylphenidate and ritalinic acid were analyzed at two concentrations (15 and 150 ng/mL) over 5 months at room temperature (~25°C), refrigerated (4°C), frozen (-20°C), and elevated (35°C) temperatures. Analytes were analyzed using a validated liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry method. Ritalinic acid concentrations increased 53% at 25°C after 24 h while d- and l-methylphenidate concentrations dropped 18.1% and 20.6%, respectively. Additionally, d- and l-ethylphenidate concentrations decreased 22.3% and 28.8%, respectively. All analytes were stable at 4°C for one week (±17% change). At -20°C, all analytes were stable for 5 months. At 35°C, l-ethylphenidate remained stable for 24 h (14.4% loss) at the high concentration while ritalinic acid increased 244%. Losses of 64.1%, 68.7% and 27.2% were observed for d-methylphenidate, l-methylphenidate and d-ethylphenidate, respectively. Due to this, a follow up study was designed to assess the breakdown of methylphenidate. The short term experiment assessed d,l-methylphenidate at two concentrations for one month in the same conditions. As methylphenidate decreased, ritalinic acid concentrations rose. At 25°C, it took two weeks for methylphenidate to metabolize completely into ritalinic acid. In refrigerated and frozen temperatures, methylphenidate did not completely metabolize to ritalinic acid. In elevated temperatures, methylphenidate broke down to ritalinic acid within two weeks. Due to this, it was concluded that d,l-methylphenidate breaks down in the blood to its metabolite ritalinic acid and may make data interpretation difficult if samples are not properly stored. The optimal storage for these analytes is recommended at -20°C.\n© The Author(s) 2021. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Society of Forensic Toxicologists, Inc. All rights reserved.

The multiple pathological events resulting from traumatic brain injury can be addressed not by a single therapeutic approach, but rather by a synergistic biotherapy capable of activating a complementary set of signaling pathways and providing synergistic neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and neurorestorative activities. Human platelet lysate might fulfill these requirements as it is comprised of a plethora of biomolecules readily accessible as a traumatic brain injury biotherapy. In the present study, we have tested the therapeutic potential of human platelet lysate using in vitro and in vivo models of traumatic brain injury. We first prepared and characterized platelet lysate from clinical-grade human platelet concentrates. Platelets were pelletized, lysed by three freeze-thaw cycles, and centrifuged. The supernatant was purified by 56 °C-30 minutes heat-treatment and spun to obtain the heat-treated platelet pellet lysate that was characterized by ELISA and proteomic analyses. Two mouse models were used to investigate platelet lysate neuroprotective potential. The injury was induced by an in-house manual controlled scratching of the animals' cortex or by controlled cortical impact injury. The platelet lysate treatment was performed by topical application of 60 µL in the lesioned area, followed by daily 60 µL intranasal administration from day 1 to 6 post-injury. Platelet lysate proteomics identified over 1000 proteins including growth factors, neurotrophins, and antioxidants. ELISA detected several neurotrophic and angiogenic factors at ca. 1-50 ng/mL levels. We demonstrate, using the two mouse models of traumatic brain injury that topical application and intranasal platelet lysate consistently improved mice motor function in the beam and rotarod tests, mitigated cortical neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress in the injury area, as revealed by downregulation of pro-inflammatory genes and the reduction in reactive oxygen species levels. Moreover, platelet lysate treatment reduced the loss of cortical synaptic proteins. Unbiased proteomic analyses revealed that HPPL reversed several pathways promoted by both CCI and CBS and related to transport, post-synaptic density, mitochondria or lipid metabolism. The present data strongly support for the first time that human platelet lysate is a reliable and effective therapeutic source of neurorestorative factors. Therefore, brain administration of platelet lysate is a therapeutical strategy that deserves serious and urgent consideration for universal brain trauma treatment.\n© The Author(s) (2021).

We investigated whether, and in which developmental stages, GWAS-implicated genes are coordinately expressed in brain transcriptome. We identified significant network modules for each disorder and trait at different developmental stages, providing a systematic view of network modularity at specific developmental stages for a myriad of brain disorders and traits. Specifically, we observed a strong pattern of the fetal origin for most psychiatric disorders and traits [such as schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and neuroticism], whereas increased co-expression activities of genes were more strongly associated with neurological diseases [such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis] and anthropometric traits (such as college completion, education and subjective well-being) in postnatal brains. Further analyses revealed enriched cell types and functional features that were supported and corroborated prior knowledge in specific brain disorders, such as clathrin-mediated endocytosis in AD, myelin sheath in multiple sclerosis and regulation of synaptic plasticity in both college completion and education.

Patients with an arm paresis indeed perceived their bodies differently. We found a transient overestimation of the length of the contralesional, paretic arm after stroke.

It has been suggested that, as a consequence of the inflammatory process during JEV infection, there is disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) tight junctions that in turn allows the virus access to the central nervous system (CNS). However, what happens at early times of JEV contact with the BBB is poorly understood. In the present work, we evaluated the ability of both a virulent and a vaccine strain of JEV (JEV RP9 and SA14-14-2, respectively) to cross an in vitro human BBB model. Using this system, we demonstrated that both JEV RP9 and SA14-14-2 are able to cross the BBB without disrupting it at early times post viral addition. Furthermore, we find that almost 10 times more RP9 infectious particles than SA14-14 cross the model BBB, indicating this BBB model discriminates between the virulent RP9 and the vaccine SA14-14-2 strains of JEV. Beyond contributing to the understanding of early events in JEV neuroinvasion, we demonstrate this in vitro BBB model can be used as a system to study the viral determinants of JEV neuroinvasiveness and the molecular mechanisms by which this flavivirus crosses the BBB during early times of neuroinvasion.\n", "authors": "Cécile Khou,Marco Aurelio Díaz-Salinas,Anaelle da Costa,Christophe Préhaud,Patricia Jeannin,Philippe V Afonso,Marco Vignuzzi,Monique Lafon,Nathalie Pardigon", "pmid": "34086776", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:03.249Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:03.249Z", "publish_date": "2021-06-04", "keywords": "", "slug": "comparative-analysis-of-neuroinvasion-by-japanese-", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 1955, "fields": {"title": "Identification of 3'-UTR single nucleotide variants and prediction of select protein imbalance in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy patients.", "body": "\nThe genetic influence in epilepsy, characterized by unprovoked and recurrent seizures, is through variants in genes critical to brain development and function. We have carried out variant calling in Mesial Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (MTLE) patients by mapping the RNA-Seq data available at SRA, NCBI, USA onto human genome assembly hg-19. We have identified 1,75,641 SNVs in patient samples. These SNVs are distributed over 14700 genes of which 655 are already known to be associated with epilepsy. Large number of variants occur in the 3'-UTR, which is one of the regions involved in the regulation of protein translation through binding of miRNAs and RNA-binding proteins (RBP). We have focused on studying the structure-function relationship of the 3'-UTR SNVs that are common to at-least 10 of the 35 patient samples. For the first time we find SNVs exclusively in the 3'-UTR of FGF12, FAR1, NAPB, SLC1A3, SLC12A6, GRIN2A, CACNB4 and FBXO28 genes. Structural modelling reveals that the variant 3'-UTR segments possess altered secondary and tertiary structures which could affect mRNA stability and binding of RBPs to form proper ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. Secondly, these SNVs have either created or destroyed miRNA-binding sites, and molecular modeling reveals that, where binding sites are created, the additional miRNAs bind strongly to 3'-UTR of only variant mRNAs. These two factors affect protein production thereby creating an imbalance in the amounts of select proteins in the cell. We suggest that in the absence of missense and nonsense variants, protein-activity imbalances associated with MTLE patients can be caused through 3'-UTR variants in relevant genes by the mechanisms mentioned above. 3'-UTR SNV has already been identified as causative variant in the neurological disorder, Tourette syndrome. Inhibition of these miRNA-mRNA bindings could be a novel way of treating drug-resistant MTLE patients. We also suggest that joint occurrence of these SNVs could serve as markers for MTLE. We find, in the present study, SNV-mediated destruction of miRNA binding site in the 3'-UTR of the gene encoding glutamate receptor subunit, and, interestingly, overexpression of one of this receptor subunit is also associated with Febrile Seizures.\n", "authors": "Tanusree Chaudhuri,Janaki Chintalapati,Madhusoodan Vijayacharya Hosur", "pmid": "34086756", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:03.252Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:03.252Z", "publish_date": "2021-06-04", "keywords": "", "slug": "identification-of-3-utr-single-nucleotide-variants", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 1956, "fields": {"title": "Early expressions of psychopathology and risk associated with trans-diagnostic transition to mood and psychotic disorders in adolescents and young adults.", "body": "\nThe heterogeneity and comorbidity of major mental disorders presenting in adolescents and young adults has fostered calls for trans-diagnostic research.

In our previous work, using a rat model of neuronal activation upon kainate-induced seizures, we observed a repositioning of Bdnf alleles from the nuclear periphery towards the nuclear center. This change of Bdnf intranuclear position was associated with transcriptional gene activity. In the present study, using the same neuronal activation model, we analyzed the relation between the percentage of the Bdnf allele at the nuclear periphery and clinical and morphological traits of epilepsy. We observed that the decrease of the percentage of the Bdnf allele at the nuclear periphery correlates with stronger mossy fiber sprouting-an aberrant form of excitatory circuits formation. Moreover, using in vitro hippocampal cultures we showed that Bdnf repositioning is a consequence of transcriptional activity. Inhibition of RNA polymerase II activity in primary cultured neurons with Actinomycin D completely blocked Bdnf gene transcription and repositioning occurring after neuronal excitation. Interestingly, we observed that histone deacetylases inhibition with Trichostatin A induced a slight increase of Bdnf gene transcription and its repositioning even in the absence of neuronal excitation.

Thus, understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying action potential firing in peripheral sensory neurons is essential in sensory biology and pathophysiology. Over the past 30 years, it has been consistently reported that these cells can display membrane potential instabilities (MPIs), in the form of subthreshold membrane potential oscillations or depolarizing spontaneous fluctuations. However, research on this subject remains sparse, without a clear conductive thread to be followed. To address this, we here provide a synthesis of the description, molecular bases, mathematical models, physiological roles, and pathophysiological implications of MPIs in peripheral sensory neurons. Membrane potential instabilities have been reported in trigeminal, dorsal root, and Mes-V ganglia, where they are believed to support repetitive firing. They are proposed to have roles also in intercellular communication, ectopic firing, and responses to tonic and slow natural stimuli. We highlight how MPIs are of great interest for the study of sensory transduction physiology and how they may represent therapeutic targets for many pathological conditions, such as acute and chronic pain, itch, and altered sensory perceptions.

In this paper, a novel 3D convolutional network, called two-stage-age-network (TSAN), is proposed to estimate brain age from T1-weighted MRI data. Compared with existing methods, TSAN has the following improvements. First, TSAN uses a two-stage cascade network architecture, where the first-stage network estimates a rough brain age, then the second-stage network estimates the brain age more accurately from the discretized brain age by the first-stage network. Second, to our knowledge, TSAN is the first work to apply novel ranking losses in brain age estimation, together with the traditional mean square error (MSE) loss. Third, densely connected paths are used to combine feature maps with different scales. The experiments with 6586 MRIs showed that TSAN could provide accurate brain age estimation, yielding mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.428 and Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.985, between the estimated and chronological ages. Furthermore, using the brain age gap between brain age and chronological age as a biomarker, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) can be distinguished from healthy control (HC) subjects by support vector machine (SVM). Classification AUC in AD/HC and MCI/HC was 0.904 and 0.823, respectively.

Existing contrast-agent-dependent methods typically rely on the estimation of the arterial input function (AIF) to approximately model tissue perfusion. These approaches neglect spatial dependencies. Further, as reliably estimating the AIF is non-trivial, different AIF estimates may lead to different perfusion measures. In this work we therefore propose PIANO, an approach that provides additional insights into the perfusion process. PIANO estimates the velocity and diffusion fields of an advection-diffusion model best explaining the contrast dynamics without using an AIF. PIANO accounts for spatial dependencies and neither requires estimating the AIF nor relies on a particular contrast agent bolus shape. Specifically, we propose a convenient parameterization of the estimation problem, a numerical estimation approach, and extensively evaluate PIANO. Simulation experiments show the robustness and effectiveness of PIANO, along with its ability to distinguish between advection and diffusion. We further apply PIANO on a public brain magnetic resonance (MR) perfusion dataset of acute stroke patients, and demonstrate that PIANO can successfully resolve velocity and diffusion field ambiguities and results in sensitive measures for the assessment of stroke, comparing favorably to conventional measures of perfusion.\n", "authors": "Peirong Liu,Yueh Z Lee,Stephen R Aylward,Marc Niethammer", "pmid": "34086563", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:13.717Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:13.717Z", "publish_date": "2021-06-04", "keywords": "", "slug": "perfusion-imaging-an-advection-diffusion-approach", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 1969, "fields": {"title": "Cortical entrainment to hierarchical contextual rhythms recomposes dynamic attending in visual perception.", "body": "\nTemporal regularity is ubiquitous and essential to guiding attention and coordinating behavior within a dynamic environment. Previous researchers have modeled attention as an internal rhythm that may entrain to first-order regularity from rhythmic events to prioritize information selection at specific time points. Using the attentional blink paradigm, here we show that higher-order regularity based on rhythmic organization of contextual features (pitch, color, or motion) may serve as a temporal frame to recompose the dynamic profile of visual temporal attention. Critically, such attentional reframing effect is well predicted by cortical entrainment to the higher-order contextual structure at the delta band as well as its coupling with the stimulus-driven alpha power. These results suggest that the human brain involuntarily exploits multiscale regularities in rhythmic contexts to recompose dynamic attending in visual perception, and highlight neural entrainment as a central mechanism for optimizing our conscious experience of the world in the time dimension.\n© 2021, Yuan et al.\n", "authors": "Peijun Yuan,Ruichen Hu,Xue Zhang,Ying Wang,Yi Jiang", "pmid": "34086558", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:13.719Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:13.719Z", "publish_date": "2021-06-04", "keywords": "attentional blink", "slug": "cortical-entrainment-to-hierarchical-contextual-rh", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 1970, "fields": {"title": "Dietary Phytoestrogens: Neuroprotective Role in Parkinson's Disease.", "body": "\nParkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive damage of mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra and the striatal projections. Recent studies suggest that estrogen and estrogen-like chemicals have beneficial effects on neurodegenerative diseases, particularly PD. Animal studies demonstrate that estrogen influences dopamine's synthesis, release, and metabolism. In vivo studies have also shown the significant beneficial effects of estrogen in shielding the brain from neurodegenerative processes like PD. Moreover, the expression and function of dopamine receptors can be modified by estrogen. Phytoestrogens are non-steroidal compounds derived from plants present in a large spectrum of foods, most specifically soy, and in numerous dietary supplements. Phytoestrogens share structural and functional similarities with 17β-estradiol and can be used as an alternative treatment for PD because of estrogen's undesirable effects, such as the increased risk of breast and endometrial cancer, ischemic disorders, and irregular bleeding. Despite the beneficial effects of phytoestrogens, their impact on human health may depend on age, health status, and even the presence or absence of specific gut microflora. In addition to their antioxidant properties, soy products or phytoestrogens also exhibit neuroprotective activity in patients with PD via interaction with estrogen receptors (ER) α and β, with a higher affinity for ERβ. Phytoestrogens offer a valuable model for fully exploring the biological effects of endocrine disruptors in general. However, observational studies and randomized controlled trials in humans have resulted in inconclusive findings within this domain. This review considered the evidence in animal models and human epidemiological data as to whether developmental exposure to various phytoestrogen classes adversely or beneficially impacts the neurobehavioral programming in PD.\nCopyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.\n", "authors": "Ahsas Goyal,Aanchal Verma,Neetu Agrawal", "pmid": "34086550", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:13.722Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:13.722Z", "publish_date": "2021-06-04", "keywords": "Dopamine", "slug": "dietary-phytoestrogens-neuroprotective-role-in-par", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 1971, "fields": {"title": "Plasma circulating cell free messenger RNA as a potential biomarker of melanoma.", "body": "\nBlood borne cell free nucleic acids are increasingly emerging as significant non-invasive adjuncts to current methods of disease status evaluation in cancer patients.

In the present study, we show that p-MEK and p-ERK are elevated in the brain of diapause-destined pupae and suppression of MEK/ERK activity terminates diapause progress. ROS activates MEK/ERK signaling, causing large-scale phosphorylation of downstream proteins. The levels of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins are also significantly reduced when ROS or p-ERK level decreased.

Galanin receptor 1 (GalR1) activation was recently shown to be anti-apoptotic in the setting of ischemic stroke. This study aimed to explore the anti-neuronal apoptosis effect of GalR1 activation after SAH, as well as the underlying mechanisms. GalR1 CRISPR and GalR1 selective agonist, M617, was administered, respectively. Extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor (U0126) and glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta (GSK3-β) CRISPR were administered to investigate the involvement of the ERK/GSK3-β pathway in GalR1-mediated neuroprotection after SAH. Outcome assessments included neurobehavioral tests, western blot, and immunohistochemistry. The results showed that endogenous ligand galanin (Gal) and GalR1 were markedly increased in the ipsilateral brain hemisphere at 12 h and 24 h after SAH. GalR1 were expressed mainly in neurons, but expression was also observed in some astrocytes and microglia. GalR1 CRISPR knockdown exacerbated neurological deficits and neuronal apoptosis 24 h after SAH. Moreover, activation of GalR1 with M617 significantly improved short- and long-term neurological deficits but decreased neuronal apoptosis after SAH. Furthermore, GalR1 activation dysregulated the protein levels of phosphorylated ERK and GSK-3β, but downregulated the phosphorylated Tat-interactive protein 60 (TIP60) and cleaved caspase-3 at 24 h after SAH. GalR1 CRISPR, U0126, and GSK-3β CRISPR abolished the beneficial effects of GalR1 activation at 24 h after SAH in rats. Collectively, the present study demonstrated that activation of GalR1 using M617 attenuated neuronal apoptosis through the ERK/GSK-3β/TIP60 pathway after SAH in rats.

In 119 participants, we assessed mood-related interindividual differences in exploration-exploitation using a foraging task that included minimal task constraints to reduce paradigm-induced biases of individual control tendencies.

Instead of having fine spatial resolution, these signals reflect the activity of neuronal populations via volume conduction (VC). Sources of traveling waves in neuroelectric potentials have not been well addressed so far. As animal studies show propagating activation of neurons that spread in measured areas, it is often considered that neuronal activations during scalp waves have similar trajectories of activation, spreading like scalp waves. However, traveling waves on the scalp differ from those found directly on the cortical surface in several dimensions: traveling velocity, traveling distance and areal size occupied by single polarity. We describe that the simplest sources can produce scalp waves with perceived spatial dimensions which are actually a magnification of neuronal activity emanating from local sources due to VC.

ADHD medication use was associated with less suicidality in children with more externalizing symptoms (significant symptom-by-medication interaction, B = -0.250; SE = 0.086; P = .004), such that for children who were not receiving ADHD medications, there was an association between more externalizing symptoms and suicidality (for a change of 1 SD in symptoms, OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.33-1.52; P < .001); however, for children who were receiving ADHD medication, there was no such association (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.97-1.35; P = .10). The association with medication remained even when covarying for multiple confounders, including risk and protective factors for suicidality in ABCD, and was replicated in 1-year longitudinal follow-up. Sensitivity analyses matching participants with high numbers of externalizing symptoms taking and not taking ADHD medication treatment confirmed its association with less suicidality.\nThese findings suggest that ADHD medication treatment is associated with less suicidality in children with substantial externalizing symptoms and may be used to inform childhood suicide prevention strategies.\n", "authors": "Gal Shoval,Elina Visoki,Tyler M Moore,Grace E DiDomenico,Stirling T Argabright,Nicholas J Huffnagle,Aaron F Alexander-Bloch,Rebecca Waller,Luke Keele,Tami D Benton,Raquel E Gur,Ran Barzilay", "pmid": "34086035", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:13.763Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:13.763Z", "publish_date": "2021-06-01", "keywords": "", "slug": "evaluation-of-attention-deficithyperactivity-disor", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 1984, "fields": {"title": "Refining the mutational spectrum and gene-phenotype correlates in pontocerebellar hypoplasia: results of a multicentric study.", "body": "\nPontocerebellar hypoplasias (PCH) comprise a group of genetically heterogeneous disorders characterised by concurrent hypoplasia of the pons and the cerebellum and variable clinical and imaging features. The current classification includes 13 subtypes, with ~20 known causative genes. Attempts have been made to delineate the phenotypic spectrum associated to specific PCH genes, yet clinical and neuroradiological features are not consistent across studies, making it difficult to define gene-specific outcomes.\nWe performed deep clinical and imaging phenotyping in 56 probands with a neuroradiological diagnosis of PCH, who underwent NGS-based panel sequencing of PCH genes and MLPA for CASK rearrangements. Next, we conducted a phenotype-based unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis to investigate associations between genes and specific phenotypic clusters.\nA genetic diagnosis was obtained in 43 probands (77%). The most common causative gene was CASK, which accounted for nearly half cases (45%) and was mutated in females and occasionally in males. The European founder mutation p.Ala307Ser in TSEN54 and pathogenic variants in EXOSC3 accounted for 18% and 9% of cases, respectively. VLDLR, TOE1 and RARS2 were mutated in single patients. We were able to confirm only few previously reported associations, including jitteriness and clonus with TSEN54 and lower motor neuron signs with EXOSC3. When considering multiple features simultaneously, a clear association with a phenotypic cluster only emerged for EXOSC3.\nCASK represents the major PCH causative gene in Italy. Phenotypic variability associated with the most common genetic causes of PCH is wider than previously thought, with marked overlap between CASK and TSEN54-associated disorders.\n© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

The portal thrombosis was handled using a portosystemic shunt from the splenic vein to the left ovarian vein, which was visualized on a computed tomography scan performed as part of the study protocol. The donor was a 52-year-old woman with brain death secondary to a vascular cerebral accident. A caval replacement technique was used with no complications during surgery. For the portal anastomosis, the dilated left ovarian vein was carefully dissected and brought through the lesser sac, behind the stomach, to obtain a suitable length. An end-to-end anastomosis of the graft portal vein to the left ovarian vein was performed with a 6-0 Prolene running suture. An abdominal computed tomography scan was performed 6 months after liver transplant showing patency of portal vein and no anastomotic defects, and after 24 months of follow-up the patient is in good clinical condition with normal laboratory values and Doppler ultrasonography with no vascular anomalies and adequate portal flow.

Secondly, 40 Sprague-Dawley male rats weighing 350 to 400 g were assigned to five groups, receiving either sham, perivascular sympathectomy, nerve-artery separation, nerve transection in the saphenous neurovascular bundle, or lumbar sympathectomy surgery that removes the lumbar sympathetic trunks. Immediately after surgery, the arterial perfusion and diameter were measured using laser speckling contrast imaging, and 1 week later the saphenous neurovascular bundles were harvested for immunostaining using antibodies against TH, neuron-specific β-tubulin (Tuj 1), and α-SMA to show the presence or absence of the TH-immuopositive staining in the adventitia. The differences among the five groups were determined using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). We found that an average of 2.8 ± 0.8 branches with a diameter of 4.8 ± 1.2 μm derived from the saphenous nerve that morphed into a primary and a secondary sympathetic trunk for innervation of the saphenous artery. Nerve-artery separation, nerve transection, and lumbar sympathectomy could eradicate TH-immunopositive staining of the artery, resulting, respectively, in a 12%, 36%, and 59% increase in diameter (P < .05), and a 52%, 63%, and 201% increase in perfusion compared with sham surgery (P < .01). In contrast, perivascular sympathectomy did not have a significant impact on the TH-immunopositive staining, the diameter, and perfusion of the distal part of the artery (P > .05). We conclude that the sympathetic innervation of an artery derives from segmental branches given off from its accompanying nerve.

An intact BBB is also critical for the maintenance of normal neuronal function. In cerebral vascular diseases and neurological disorders, the BBB can be disrupted, contributing to disease progression. While restoration of BBB integrity serves as a robust biomarker of better clinical outcomes, the restrictive nature of the intact BBB presents a major hurdle for delivery of therapeutics into the brain. Recent studies show that the BBB is actively engaged in crosstalk between neuronal and the circulatory systems, which defines another important role of the BBB: as an interfacing conduit that mediates communication between two sides of the BBB. This role has been subject to extensive investigation for brain-targeted drug delivery and shows promising results. The dual roles of the BBB make it a unique target for drug development. Here, recent developments and novel strategies to target the BBB for therapeutic purposes are reviewed, from both barrier and carrier perspectives.\n© 2021 The Authors.

However, the longevity of such implanted devices remains limited by the deterioration of their signal sensitivity over time due to acute inflammation from insertion trauma and chronic inflammation caused by the foreign body reaction. To address this challenge, a lubricated surface is fabricated to minimize friction during insertion and avoid immunogenicity during neural signal recording. Reduced friction force leads to 86% less impulse on the brain tissue, and thus immediately increases the number of measured signal electrodes by 102% upon insertion. Furthermore, the signal measurable period increases from 8 to 16 weeks due to the prevention of gliosis. By significantly reducing insertion damage and the foreign body reaction, the lubricated immune-stealthy probe surface (LIPS) can maximize the longevity of implantable BMIs.\n© 2021 The Authors.

NL3R451C mice displayed enhanced ability to attend to stimuli when task-load was low during training and baseline but lost this advantage when difficulty was increased by altering task parameters in probe trials. NL3R451C mice made less responses to the distractor stimuli, exhibiting lower false alarm rates during all training stages and in probe trials. Slower response times and quicker reward latencies were consistently seen in NL3R451C mice in the rCPT.

Dynamic amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (dALFF) was used to examine the dynamic temporal variability in 93 participants (63 smokers, 30 nonsmokers). We further divided smokers into light and heavy smokers. The temporal variability in intrinsic brain activity among these groups was compared. Correlation analyses were performed between dALFF in areas showing group differences and smoking behaviour (e.g., the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence [FTND] scores and pack-years). Smokers showed significantly increased dALFF in the left inferior/middle frontal gyrus, right orbitofrontal gyrus, right insula, left superior/medial frontal gyrus and right middle frontal gyrus than nonsmokers. Light smokers showed increased dALFF variability in the left prefrontal cortex. Heavy smokers showed increased dynamics in specific brain regions, including the right postcentral gyrus, right insula and left precentral gyrus. Furthermore, the temporal variability in dALFF in the left superior/medial frontal gyrus, left superior/middle frontal gyrus, right middle frontal gyrus and right insula was positively correlated with pack-years or FTND. Combined, these results suggest that smokers increase stable and persistent spontaneous brain activity in prefrontal cortex, involved impaired gold-directed action and value-based decision-making.

The robust nightly peak of melatonin secretion is an output signal of the circadian clock to the whole organism. However, so far the regulatory roles of endogenous melatonin in mammalian biological rhythms and physiology processes are poorly understood. Here we establish congenic mouse lines (>N10 generations) that are proficient or deficient in melatonin synthesis (AH+/+ or AH-/- mice, respectively) on the C57BL/6J genetic background by crossing melatonin-proficient MSM/Ms with C57BL/6J. AH+/+ mice displayed robust nightly peak of melatonin secretion and had significantly higher levels of pineal and plasma melatonin versus AH-/- mice. Using this mice model, we investigated the role of endogenous melatonin in regulating multiple biological rhythms, physiological processes, and rhythmic behaviors. In the melatonin-proficient (AH+/+) mice, the rate of re-entrainment of wheel running activity was accelerated following a 6-hour phase advance of dark onset when comparted with AH-/- mice, suggesting a role of endogenous melatonin in facilitating adjustment to new dark onset. Further in the AH+/+ mice there was a significant decrease in body weight, gonadal weight and reproductive performance, and a significant increase in daily torpor (a hypothermic and hypometabolic state lasting only hours during adverse conditions). Endogenous melatonin, however, had no effect in the modulation of the diurnal rhythm of 2-[125 I]-iodomelatonin receptor expression in the SCN, free-running wheel behavior in constant darkness, life span, spontaneous home cage behaviors, and various types of social-emotional behaviors. The findings also shed light on the role of endogenous melatonin in mice domestication and provides new insights into melatonin's action in reducing energy expenditure during a food shortage. In summary, the congenic mice model generated in this study offers a significant advantage towards understanding of the role of endogenous melatonin in regulating melatonin receptor mediated rhythm behaviors and physiological functions.\nThis article is protected by copyright.

The rhythm and secretion of melatonin is under the control of an endogenous oscillator located in the SCN or the master biological clock. Disruptions in circadian rhythms by shift work, aging, or light at night is associated with bone loss and increased fracture risk. Restoration of nocturnal melatonin peaks to normal levels or therapeutic levels through timed melatonin supplementation has been demonstrated to provide bone-protective actions in various models. Melatonin is a unique molecule with diverse molecular actions targeting melatonin receptors located on the plasma membrane or mitochondria or acting independently of receptors through its actions as an antioxidant or free radical scavenger to stimulate osteoblastogenesis, inhibit osteoclastogenesis, and improve bone density. Its additional actions on entraining circadian rhythms and improving quality of life in an aging population coupled with its safety profile makes it an ideal therapeutic candidate for protecting against bone loss in susceptible populations. The intent of this review is to provide a focused discussion on bone loss and disorders of the bone as it relates to melatonin and conditions that modify melatonin levels with the hope that future therapies include those that include melatonin and correct those factors that modify melatonin levels like circadian disruption.\nThis article is protected by copyright.

Changes in the laws have heightened interest and encouraged research into both cannabinoid products and the potential harms of Cannabis use, addiction and intoxication.

When used in the form of the plant marijuana, because of the many compounds that exist in the plant form they could inhibit the activity of the CB1 receptor thereby reducing many of the effects of THC. While this mechanism seems correct, in our opinion, Vallee., et al. incorrectly suggest that blocking CB1 receptors could open unforeseen approaches to the treatment of cannabis intoxication and addiction. We caution the scientific community that, other CB1 receptor blockers, such as, Rimonabant (SR141718) have been pulled off the market in Europe. In addition, CB1 receptor blockers were rejected by the FDA due to mood changes including suicide ideation. We argue that one issue facing the scientific community, has to do with the increasing legalization of Cannabis products in many states across America. We are in favor of some reform in terms of either decriminalization or restrictive legalization especially in control of legal limits of THC. Like other psychoactive compounds at high doses, it is our hypothesis that chronic use of these drugs including high THC content in its various forms (wax, smoke or vapor) resulting in brain reward dysfunction induces an imbalance of neurotransmission and subsequent hypodopaminergia and lead to aberrant substance and non-substance (behavioral) addictions.

However, tumor genotype, such as MGMT and IDH, which has been proven to have strong relationship with OS, is completely not considered in pre-operative prognosis as the genotype information is unavailable until craniotomy. In this paper, we propose a new deep learning based method for OS time prediction. It can derive genotype related features from pre-operative multimodal MR images of brain tumor patients to guide OS time prediction. Particularly, we propose a multi-task convolutional neural network (CNN) to accomplish tumor genotype and OS time prediction tasks.

Heterogeneity among stimulation parameters across studies makes it difficult to implement reliable transcranial alternating current stimulation protocols, explaining the absence of consensus on optimal stimulation parameters to modulate the alpha rhythm. This project documents the differential impact of controlling for key transcranial alternating current stimulation parameters, namely the intensity, the frequency and the stimulation site (anterior versus posterior). Phase 1:20 healthy participants underwent 4 different stimulation conditions. In each experimental condition, stimulation via 2 electrodes was delivered for 20 min. Stimulation conditions were administered at PO7-PO8 or F3-F4 at individual's alpha frequency, or at individual's theta frequency or sham. Stimulation intensity was set according to each participant's comfort following a standardized unpleasantness scale (≤ 40 out of 100) and could not exceed 6 mA. All conditions were counterbalanced. Phase 2: participants who tolerated higher intensity of stimulation (4-6 mA) underwent alpha-frequency stimulation applied over PO7-PO8 at 1 mA to investigate within-subject modulation of stimulation response according to stimulation intensity. Whether set over posterior or anterior cortical sites, alpha-frequency stimulation showed greater increase in alpha power relative to stimulation at theta frequency and sham stimulation. Posterior alpha-frequency stimulation showed a greater increase in alpha power relative to the adjacent frequency bands over frontal and occipito-parietal brain areas. Low intensity (1 mA) posterior alpha stimulation showed a similar increase in alpha power than at high (4-6 mA) intensity when measured immediately after stimulation. However, when tested at 60 min or 120 min, low intensity stimulation was associated with significantly superior alpha power increase relative to high intensity stimulation. This study shows that posterior individual's alpha frequency stimulation at higher intensities is well tolerated but fails to increase stimulation aftereffects recorded within 2 h of stimulation on brain oscillations of the corresponding frequency band. In sharp contrast, stimulating at 1 mA (regardless of phosphene generation or sensory perception) effectively and selectively modulates alpha power within that 2-h time window, thus validating that it as a reliable stimulus intensity for future studies. This study also shows that posterior alpha-frequency stimulation preferentially modulates endogenous brain oscillations of the corresponding frequency band.

Unfortunately, treatment options for ALS are limited, and therefore, novel therapies that prevent further motor neuron degeneration are of dire need. In ALS, the infiltration of pathological elements from the blood to the central nervous system (CNS) compartment that spur motor neuron damage may be prevented via restoration of the impaired blood-CNS-barrier. Transplantation of human bone marrow endothelial progenitor cells (hBM-EPCs) demonstrated therapeutic promise in a mouse model of ALS due to their capacity to mitigate the altered blood-CNS-barrier by restoring endothelial cell (EC) integrity. Remarkably, the hBM-EPCs can release angiogenic factors that endogenously ameliorate impaired ECs. In addition, these cells may produce extracellular vesicles (EVs) that carry a wide range of vesicular factors, which aid in alleviating EC damage. In an in vitro study, hBM-EPC-derived EVs were effectively uptaken by the mouse brain endothelial cells (mBECs) and cell damage was significantly attenuated. Interestingly, the incorporation of EVs into mBECs was inhibited via β1 integrin hindrance. This review explores preclinical studies of the therapeutic potential of hBM-EPCs, specifically via hBM-EPC-derived EVs, for the repair of the damaged blood-CNS-barrier in ALS as a novel treatment approach.\nCopyright: © 2021 Brain Circulation.\n", "authors": "Nadia Sadanandan,Jea-Young Lee,Svitlana Garbuzova-Davis", "pmid": "34084973", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:13.894Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:13.894Z", "publish_date": "2021-03-30", "keywords": "ALS", "slug": "extracellular-vesicle-based-therapy-for-amyotrophi", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 2028, "fields": {"title": "Stem cell secretome derived from human amniotic fluid affords neuroprotection in an ischemic model.", "body": "\nHuman amniotic fluid stem cells (hAFSCs) are growing in interest; yet, little is understood about their secretome and neuroprotective actions in different diseases, including stroke.

Critical vessel characteristics including the degree of angulation and tortuosity influence the ability to advance stent retriever devices toward the site of occlusion. Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate the impact of carotid artery catheter pathway accessibility on the thrombectomy outcomes in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients. Traditional imaging modalities generate incomplete pictures of the vascular tortuosity and are prone to clinical judgment errors. Recent three-dimensional computed tomography angiography image analysis techniques circumvent these limitations to calculate accurate tortuosity and angulation measurements. These novel images facilitate classifying common anatomical variant patients into groups that may be treated with specially designed catheter devices. Importantly, this image analysis method reveals significant angulation in the common carotid artery and extracranial internal carotid artery that correlates with delays in reaching the occlusion site. Increased age, which is associated with increased risk of stroke, also increases the incidence of severe tortuosity. The semi-automated measurements technique also demonstrate that full 360° arterial loops are present in nearly 3% of catheter pathways and that the overall degree of angulation differs bilaterally. In this review, we examine the utility of this novel image analysis procedure and evaluate the recent literature relevant to neuroendovascular thrombectomy in AIS patients.

Since the volume of data provided by the dataset is not large enough to effectively train a Deep CNN model, it is also proposed a data augmentation technique to achieve better performance. An evaluation protocol is proposed to assess the robustness regarding the number of EEG channels and also to enforce train and test sets without individual overlapping.

It is crucial to predict epilepsy, which is common in the community. Early diagnosis is essential to reduce the treatment process of the disease and to keep the process healthier.\nIn this study, a five-classes dataset was used: EEG signals from different individuals, healthy EEG signals from tumor document, EEG signal with epilepsy, EEG signal with eyes closed, and EEG signal with eyes open. Four different methods have been proposed to classify five classes of EEG signals. In the first approach, the EEG signal was first divided into four different bands (beta, alpha, theta, and delta), and then 25 time-domain features were extracted from each band, and the main EEG signal and these extracted features were combined to obtain 125-time domain features (feature extraction). Using the Random Forests classifier, EEG activities were classified into five classes. In the second approach, each One-Against-One (OVO) approach with 125 attributes was split into ten parts, pairwise, and then each piece was classified with the Random Forests classifier. The majority voting scheme was used to combine decisions from the ten classifiers. In the third proposed method, each One-Against-All (OVA) approach with 125 attributes was divided into five parts, and then each piece was classified with the Random Forests classifier. The majority voting scheme was used to combine decisions from the five classifiers. In the fourth proposed approach, each One-Against-All (OVA) approach with 125 attributes was divided into five parts. Since each piece obtained had an imbalanced data distribution, an adaptive synthetic (ADASYN) sampling approach was used to stabilize each piece. Then, each balanced piece was classified with the Random Forests classifier. To combine the decisions obtanied from each classifier, the majority voting scheme has been used.\nThe first approach achieved 71.90% classification success in classifying five-class EEG signals. The second approach achieved a classification success of 91.08% in classifying five-class EEG signals. The third method achieved 89% success, while the fourth proposed approach achieved 91.72% success. The results obtained show that the proposed fourth approach (the combination of the ADASYN sampling approach and Random Forest Classifier) achieved the best success in classifying five class EEG signals.

Granger causality (GC) represents one of the most employed approaches, based on modeling the system dynamics with a linear vector autoregressive (VAR) model and on evaluating the information flow between two processes in terms of prediction error variances. In its most advanced setting, GC analysis is performed through a state-space (SS) representation of the VAR model that allows to compute both conditional and unconditional forms of GC by solving only one regression problem. While this problem is typically solved through Ordinary Least Square (OLS) estimation, a viable alternative is to use Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) implemented in a simple structure with one input and one output layer and trained in a way such that the weights matrix corresponds to the matrix of VAR parameters. In this work, we introduce an ANN combined with SS models for the computation of GC. The ANN is trained through the Stochastic Gradient Descent L1 (SGD-L1) algorithm, and a cumulative penalty inspired from penalized regression is applied to the network weights to encourage sparsity. Simulating networks of coupled Gaussian systems, we show how the combination of ANNs and SGD-L1 allows to mitigate the strong reduction in accuracy of OLS identification in settings of low ratio between number of time series points and of VAR parameters. We also report how the performances in GC estimation are influenced by the number of iterations of gradient descent and by the learning rate used for training the ANN. We recommend using some specific combinations for these parameters to optimize the performance of GC estimation. Then, the performances of ANN and OLS are compared in terms of GC magnitude and statistical significance to highlight the potential of the new approach to reconstruct causal coupling strength and network topology even in challenging conditions of data paucity. The results highlight the importance of of a proper selection of regularization parameter which determines the degree of sparsity in the estimated network. Furthermore, we apply the two approaches to real data scenarios, to study the physiological network of brain and peripheral interactions in humans under different conditions of rest and mental stress, and the effects of the newly emerged concept of remote synchronization on the information exchanged in a ring of electronic oscillators. The results highlight how ANNs provide a mesoscopic description of the information exchanged in networks of multiple interacting physiological systems, preserving the most active causal interactions between cardiovascular, respiratory and brain systems. Moreover, ANNs can reconstruct the flow of directed information in a ring of oscillators whose statistical properties can be related to those of physiological networks.\n© 2021 Antonacci et al.\n", "authors": "Yuri Antonacci,Ludovico Minati,Luca Faes,Riccardo Pernice,Giandomenico Nollo,Jlenia Toppi,Antonio Pietrabissa,Laura Astolfi", "pmid": "34084917", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:13.918Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:13.918Z", "publish_date": "2021-05-18", "keywords": "Artificial neural networks", "slug": "estimation-of-granger-causality-through-artificial", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 2037, "fields": {"title": "The protective effect of early dietary fat consumption on Alzheimer's disease-related pathology and cognitive function in mice.", "body": "\nIt has been suggested that obesity may influence Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, yet the numerous publications on this topic have inconsistent results and conclusions.\nOur study examined the effect of varying the timing of high-fat diet (HFD) consumption on AD-related pathology and cognition in transgenic Tg6799 AD mice.\nHFD feeding starting at or before 3 months of age, prior to severe AD pathology, had protective effects in AD mice: reduced extracellular amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition, decreased fibrinogen extravasation into the brain parenchyma, and improved cognitive function.

The theory synthesis includes three stages: (i) selection of focal concept (the concept of \"moral obligation to provide holistic care until the last minute\" was selected); (ii) review of studies to identify the factors related to focal concept relevant studies (42 articles were reviewed, statements and concepts related to focal concept were then extracted and classified, and their relations were specified); and (iii) organization of concepts and statements within a relevant general and effective manifestation of the phenomenon under study which led to developing of a model.\nIn this supportive model/theory, \"improving psychological security and empowerment\" was conceptualized within the conceptual framework. This supportive model entails three main components, including (i) informational and educational support, (ii) systematically support, and (iii) management support.\nAccording to the results, nurses with moral obligation to provide holistic care were faced with several challenges. Therefore, it is recommended that the healthcare system take supportive proceedings for nurses in various fields of the care for brain dead patients to resolve educational, moral, and legal challenges. This supportive model is essential for maintaining the nurses' health, increasing the quality of nursing care and the health of potential transplant organs.\nCopyright: © 2021 Journal of Education and Health Promotion.\n", "authors": "Hamideh Yazdimoghaddam,Zahra Sadat Manzari,Abbas Heydari,Eesa Mohammadi", "pmid": "34084848", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:13.932Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:13.932Z", "publish_date": "2021-03-31", "keywords": "Empowerment", "slug": "improving-psychological-security-and-empowerment-n", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 2042, "fields": {"title": "Pharmacological Approach for Neuroprotection After Cardiac Arrest-A Narrative Review of Current Therapies and Future Neuroprotective Cocktail.", "body": "\nCardiac arrest (CA) results in global ischemia-reperfusion injury damaging tissues in the whole body. The landscape of therapeutic interventions in resuscitation medicine has evolved from focusing solely on achieving return of circulation to now exploring options to mitigate brain injury and preserve brain function after CA. CA pathology includes mitochondrial damage and endoplasmic reticulum stress response, increased generation of reactive oxygen species, neuroinflammation, and neuronal excitotoxic death. Current non-pharmacologic therapies, such as therapeutic hypothermia and extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation, have shown benefits in protecting against ischemic brain injury and improving neurological outcomes post-CA, yet their application is difficult to institute ubiquitously. The current preclinical pharmacopeia to address CA and the resulting brain injury utilizes drugs that often target singular pathways and have been difficult to translate from the bench to the clinic. Furthermore, the limited combination therapies that have been attempted have shown mixed effects in conferring neuroprotection and improving survival post-CA. The global scale of CA damage and its resultant brain injury necessitates the future of CA interventions to simultaneously target multiple pathways and alleviate the hemodynamic, mitochondrial, metabolic, oxidative, and inflammatory processes in the brain. This narrative review seeks to highlight the current field of post-CA neuroprotective pharmaceutical therapies, both singular and combination, and discuss the use of an extensive multi-drug cocktail therapy as a novel approach to treat CA-mediated dysregulation of multiple pathways, enhancing survival, and neuroprotection.\nCopyright © 2021 Choudhary, Shoaib, Sohnen, Rolston, Jafari, Miyara, Hayashida, Molmenti, Kim and Becker.\n", "authors": "Rishabh C Choudhary,Muhammad Shoaib,Samantha Sohnen,Daniel M Rolston,Daniel Jafari,Santiago J Miyara,Kei Hayashida,Ernesto P Molmenti,Junhwan Kim,Lance B Becker", "pmid": "34084772", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:13.935Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:13.935Z", "publish_date": "2021-05-18", "keywords": "cardiopulmonary arrest", "slug": "pharmacological-approach-for-neuroprotection-after", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 2043, "fields": {"title": "Central Nervous System Involvement in Adult-Onset Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis.", "body": "\nHemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a life-threatening disease marked by high cytokine levels, uncontrolled lymphocyte, and macrophage proliferation.

Lack of awareness surrounding concussion impedes prevention, identification, and treatment. This study aims to assess parental knowledge and attitudes regarding concussions in youth baseball before and after administering an educational intervention called PitchSafe. PitchSafe is a short video that contains examples of baseball-related head injuries such as collisions, falls, and direct hits by baseballs; the signs and symptoms of a concussion; testimony from a former baseball player who sustained a TBI playing baseball; and a brochure detailing the potential signs, symptoms, and treatment plans associated with concussions. Methodology The Rosenbaum Concussion Knowledge and Attitudes Survey (RoCKAS) was used to assess three indices of parental understanding of concussion: Concussion Knowledge Index (CKI), Concussion Attitudes Index (CAI), and signs and symptoms of concussions (SS). The RoCKAS was administered at baseline and after the PitchSafe tool was administered. Parents were re-assessed one year following the initial distribution of survey materials utilizing the long-term follow-up (LTFU) RoCKAS. A paired sample t-test was conducted to compare the baseline, post-intervention (PI), and LTFU CKI, CAI, and SS among participants. Results The mean scores for CKI were 68% ± 12%, 76% ± 4%, and 76% ± 5% for baseline, PI, and LTFU, respectively. The mean scores for SS were 46% ± 20%, 62% ± 14%, and 64% ± 16% for baseline, PI, and LTFU, respectively. The mean scores for CAI were 87% ± 6%, 91% ± 5%, and 92% ± 4% for baseline, PI, and LTFU, respectively. Conclusions PitchSafe increased youth baseball parents' long-term knowledge of concussions, ability to identify signs and symptoms of concussions, and may promote safer attitudes toward concussions. These findings support more widespread use of educational tools through social media and in clinical settings.\nCopyright © 2021, Labiste et al.\n", "authors": "Chase C Labiste,Evan McElroy,Sotiris Chaniotakis,Nicolette Duong,Farzanna Haffizulla", "pmid": "34084667", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:13.945Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:13.945Z", "publish_date": "2021-04-28", "keywords": "brain concussion", "slug": "effectiveness-of-pitchsafe-on-knowledge-and-attitu", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 2045, "fields": {"title": "Chronic subdural hematoma in patients over 65 years old: Results of using a postoperative cognitive evaluation to determine whether to permit return to driving.", "body": "\nChronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is usually associated with good recovery with burr hole irrigation and postoperative drainage under local anesthesia.

To reduce Aβ plaques and ROS to maintain their homeostasis is an emerging and ingenious strategy for effective treatment of AD. Herein, we report the rational design of multifunctional micelles (MPGLT) based on a polymer-grafted peptide to simultaneously clear Aβ and ROS for AD therapy. The MPGLT integrating three functional peptides as a ROS scavenger (tk-GSH), β-sheet breaker (LP) and an autophagy activator (TK) respectively, could capture and degrade Aβ. Meanwhile, the tk-GSH on the surface of MPGLT effectively scavenges the intracellular ROS. Consequently, MPGLT reduced the cytotoxicity of Aβ and ROS. In vivo animal studies using an AD mouse model further showed that MPGLT could transport across the blood-brain barrier for decreasing the Aβ plaque and eliminating ROS in vivo.

More needs to be understood about developmental changes in healthy and unhealthy food perceptions and preference. We investigated how food perceptions and preference vary as a function of age and how food attributes (taste and health) impact age-related changes. One hundred thirty-nine participants (8-23 years, 60 females) completed computerized tasks to rate high-calorie and low-calorie food cues for taste, health, and liking (preference), followed by 100 binary food choices based on each participant's ratings. Dietary self-control was considered successful when the healthier (vs. tastier) food was chosen. Self-control success ratio was the proportion of success trials over total number of choices. Beta-weights for health (β-health) and taste (β-taste) were calculated as each attribute's influence on food preference. Adiposity measurements included BMI z-score and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR). High-calorie foods were rated more tasty and less healthy with increasing age. Older participants liked high-calorie foods more (vs. younger participants), and β-taste was associated with age. Significant age-by-WHtR interactions were observed for health and taste ratings of high-calorie foods, β-taste, and marginally for preference of high-calorie foods. Stratifying by WHtR (high, low), we found age-related increases in taste and preference ratings of high-calorie foods in the high WHtR group alone. In contrast, age-related decreases in health ratings of high-calorie foods were significant in the low WHtR group alone. Age and β-taste were significantly associated in the high WHtR group and only marginally significant with low WHtR. Although participants rated low-calorie foods as less tasty and less healthy with increasing age, there was no association between age and preference for low-calorie foods. Participants made faster food choices with increasing age regardless of WHtR, with a significant age-by-WHtR interaction on reaction time (RT). There were no age-related effects in self-control success ratio and β-health. These results suggest that individual differences in age and central adiposity play an important role in preference for high-calorie foods, and a higher importance of food tastiness in food choice may contribute to greater preference for high-calorie foods with increasing age.\nCopyright © 2021 Serrano-Gonzalez, Herting, Lim, Sullivan, Kim, Espinoza, Koppin, Javier, Kim and Luo.\n", "authors": "Monica Serrano-Gonzalez,Megan M Herting,Seung-Lark Lim,Nicolette J Sullivan,Robert Kim,Juan Espinoza,Christina M Koppin,Joyce R Javier,Mimi S Kim,Shan Luo", "pmid": "34084148", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:14.003Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:14.003Z", "publish_date": "2021-05-18", "keywords": "adolescents", "slug": "developmental-changes-in-food-perception-and-prefe", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 2064, "fields": {"title": "Targeting Neuroinflammation in Brain Cancer: Uncovering Mechanisms, Pharmacological Targets, and Neuropharmaceutical Developments.", "body": "\nGliomas are one of the most lethal types of cancers accounting for ∼80% of all central nervous system (CNS) primary malignancies. Among gliomas, glioblastomas (GBM) are the most aggressive, characterized by a median patient survival of fewer than 15  months. Recent molecular characterization studies uncovered the genetic signatures and methylation status of gliomas and correlate these with clinical prognosis. The most relevant molecular characteristics for the new glioma classification are IDH mutation, chromosome 1p/19q deletion, histone mutations, and other genetic parameters such as ATRX loss, TP53, and TERT mutations, as well as DNA methylation levels. Similar to other solid tumors, glioma progression is impacted by the complex interactions between the tumor cells and immune cells within the tumor microenvironment. The immune system's response to cancer can impact the glioma's survival, proliferation, and invasiveness. Salient characteristics of gliomas include enhanced vascularization, stimulation of a hypoxic tumor microenvironment, increased oxidative stress, and an immune suppressive milieu. These processes promote the neuro-inflammatory tumor microenvironment which can lead to the loss of blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. The consequences of a compromised BBB are deleteriously exposing the brain to potentially harmful concentrations of substances from the peripheral circulation, adversely affecting neuronal signaling, and abnormal immune cell infiltration; all of which can lead to disruption of brain homeostasis. In this review, we first describe the unique features of inflammation in CNS tumors. We then discuss the mechanisms of tumor-initiating neuro-inflammatory microenvironment and its impact on tumor invasion and progression. Finally, we also discuss potential pharmacological interventions that can be used to target neuro-inflammation in gliomas.\nCopyright © 2021 Alghamri, McClellan, Hartlage, Haase, Faisal, Thalla, Dabaja, Banerjee, Carney, Mujeeb, Olin, Moon, Schwendeman, Lowenstein and Castro.\n", "authors": "Mahmoud S Alghamri,Brandon L McClellan,Margaret S Hartlage,Santiago Haase,Syed Mohd Faisal,Rohit Thalla,Ali Dabaja,Kaushik Banerjee,Stephen V Carney,Anzar A Mujeeb,Michael R Olin,James J Moon,Anna Schwendeman,Pedro R Lowenstein,Maria G Castro", "pmid": "34084145", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:14.005Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:14.005Z", "publish_date": "2021-05-18", "keywords": "glioma", "slug": "targeting-neuroinflammation-in-brain-cancer-uncove", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 2065, "fields": {"title": "Chinese Herbal Medicine Xingnaojing Injection for Acute Ischemic Stroke: An Overview of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses.", "body": "\nBackground: Xingnaojing injection (XNJ) is the only Chinese herbal injection approved for both intracerebral hemorrhage and ischemic stroke (IS) first-aid on ambulances in China; many systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyses (MAs) of XNJ on stroke have been published. The purpose of this research was to evaluate and summarize the current evidence on XNJ for IS. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted for SRs and MAs of XNJ on IS in seven databases up to January 1, 2021. Two authors independently identified SRs and MAs, extracted data, assessed the quality of the included SRs and MAs using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews 2 (AMSTAR 2), and assessed quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE). Results: A total of 10 SRs met the inclusion criteria. The quality of included SRs using AMSTAR 2 was critically low as the critical items were poorly reported. Only 10% of SRs reported 50% of the 16 items, while the remaining 90% SRs reported just less than half of the items on AMSTAR 2. For GRADE, 7 (35%) of outcomes had low-quality evidence, 10 (50%) with very low, and 3 (15%) with moderate quality evidence. Very low to low quality of evidence indicated XNJ plus conventional therapy (CT) alleviated the neurological deficits of acute IS. Moderate-quality evidence showed XNJ plus CT reduced mortality when compared to Danshen injection plus CT, and very low-quality evidence showed XNJ plus CT could not improve the degree of coma, while low-quality evidence indicated the opposite. Mild adverse events in the CT group were less than those in the XNJ plus CT group, and there were no serious adverse events, but there was no statistical difference between the two groups. The included 10 SRs indicated that XNJ was used for acute IS, but only four SRs (40%) reported the course of disease. Conclusion: XNJ appears to be effective and safe for acute IS in improving the neurological deficits, but the evidence is not robust enough. However, whether administering XNJ immediately after or within 24 h of IS is best remains unknown due to the lack of data. Well-designed large-scale randomized controlled trials with measurable outcomes are required in future studies.\nCopyright © 2021 Tian, Feng, Xie, Xu, Zhang, Kong, An, Ma, Robinson, Gao and Liu.\n", "authors": "Zi-Yu Tian,Lu-Da Feng,Yao Xie,De-Hao Xu,Chong-Yang Zhang,Ling-Bo Kong,Rong-Rong An,Li-Fang Ma,Nicola Robinson,Ying Gao,Jian-Ping Liu", "pmid": "34084137", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:14.008Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:14.008Z", "publish_date": "2021-05-18", "keywords": "Chinese herbal medicine", "slug": "chinese-herbal-medicine-xingnaojing-injection-for-", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 2066, "fields": {"title": "Decoding Spatial Memory Retrieval in Cubical Space Using fMRI Signals.", "body": "\nThe way spatial memory retrieval is represented in the brain remains unclear to date. Previous studies have displayed a hippocampus-centered navigation network using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis. There have been some studies on the representation of navigation behavior by signal distribution patterns, but only in the hippocampus and adjacent structures. In this study, we aimed to determine (1) the brain regions that represent information in both intensity and distribution patterns during spatial memory retrieval and (2) whether the patterns of neural responses represent spatial memory retrieval behavior performance. Both univariate analysis [general linear model (GLM)] and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) were employed to reveal the spatial distributions of brain responses elicited by spatial memory retrieval. Correlation analyses were performed to detect the correspondences between brain responses and behavior performance. We found that spatial memory retrieval occurred in widespread brain regions, including the bilateral hippocampi, bilateral superior frontal gyrus, bilateral superior parietal lobules, bilateral occipital lobes, and cerebellum. The amplitude of activation in the left hippocampus showed a significant negative correlation (r = -0.46, p = 0.039) with the number of task completions. Additionally, within-subject classification accuracies based on the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal patterns of the right middle temporal gyrus (rMTG) rostral areas in the Brainnetome Atlas showed a significant positive correlation (r = 0.78, p < 0.0001) with retrieval accuracy. In summary, our findings have implications for understanding the separation between navigational and non-navigational states and emphasizing the utility of MVPA in the whole brain.\nCopyright © 2021 Guo, Zhang, Zhang, Zhao, Liang, Lin, Yu, Qin and Yang.\n", "authors": "Jiahe Guo,Kai Zhang,Jianyu Zhang,Rui Zhao,Yibo Liang,Yu Lin,Shengping Yu,Wen Qin,Xuejun Yang", "pmid": "34084128", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:14.010Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:14.010Z", "publish_date": "2021-05-18", "keywords": "GLM", "slug": "decoding-spatial-memory-retrieval-in-cubical-space", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 2067, "fields": {"title": "A prospective study of the effect of testosterone escape on preradiotherapy prostate-specific antigen kinetics in prostate cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy.", "body": "\nProstate-specific antigen (PSA) kinetic patterns during neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy have been shown to predict unfavorable long-term outcomes.\nTo investigate the effect of testosterone escape (TE) on these kinetic patterns, as this had not been previously reported.\nThere were 50 consecutive prostate cancer patients who received 6 months of triptorelin prior to definitive radiotherapy (RT).

Multichannel neural spikes are recorded from the cerebral cortex and converted in real time into electrical stimuli delivered to the lumbar spinal cord below the level of the injury, resulting in distinct patterns of hindlimb muscle activation.\n", "authors": "Shahab Shahdoost,Shawn B Frost,David J Guggenmos,Jordan Borrell,Caleb Dunham,Scott Barbay,Randolph J Nudo,Pedram Mohseni", "pmid": "34083886", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:14.024Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:14.024Z", "publish_date": "2018-01-17", "keywords": "Brain-spinal interface", "slug": "a-brain-spinal-interface-bsi-system-on-chip-soc-fo", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 2072, "fields": {"title": "Evaluation of Hippocampal Function in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy: Spatial Bayesian Variable Selection and Grouping the Regression Coefficient in Multilevel Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Data Analysis.", "body": "\nA pre-surgical evaluation of cognitive functions in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) is critical. The limitations of the usual brain analysis model were resolved by the spatial Bayesian variable selection (SBVS) method. An Ising and Dirichlet Process (Ising-DP) model considers SBVS and the grouping of a large number of voxels. The present study aimed to identify brain areas involved in episodic memory in patients with right mTLE and controls via the Ising-DP model. The model was extended to include between-subject factors (BSFs), and the results were compared with other classical methods.\nThe present cross-sectional study was conducted on 15 patients with right mTLE and 20 controls in Tehran, Iran, in 2018. During functional magnetic resonance imaging, the subjects were tested with the face-encoding memory task, followed by a recognition memory test. The participants demographic factors such as age, sex, marital status, area of residence, and years of schooling were considered to comprise BSFs. The independent t test, the chi-square test, and the correlation test were conducted using the SPSS software (version 20.0). The image processing was carried out using SPM (version 12.0) and MATLAB (version R2014a).\nThe Ising-DP model appropriately (R2=0.642) detected activated hippocampal areas. The model adjusted for BSFs indicated a better fit by the significant effect of age (P((γ]&gt;0.91), sex (P[γ]&gt;0.87), and years of schooling (P[γ]&gt;0.89). The heat maps exhibited decreased activation in the right hippocampal region in the patients compared with the controls (P<0.0001). Right hippocampal activity had a significant positive correlation with the recognition memory test in the mTLE group (r=0.665) and the control group (r=0.593).\nThe Ising-DP model was sufficiently sensitive to detect activated areas in our patients with right mTLE during the face-encoding memory task. Since the model adjusted for BSFs improved sensitivity, we recommend the use of more detailed BSFs such as seizure history in future research.\nCopyright: © Iranian Journal of Medical Sciences.\n", "authors": "Roghaye Zare,Hooshang Saberi,Mahboubeh Parsaeian,Abbas Rahimiforoushani", "pmid": "34083851", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:14.026Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:14.026Z", "publish_date": null, "keywords": " Bayes theorem", "slug": "evaluation-of-hippocampal-function-in-temporal-lob", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 2073, "fields": {"title": "Spatial transcriptomics at subspot resolution with BayesSpace.", "body": "\nRecent spatial gene expression technologies enable comprehensive measurement of transcriptomic profiles while retaining spatial context.

Mapping the transposon insertion site revealed the disruption of a long non-coding RNA, named DINOR for DNA damage-inducible non-coding RNA. Deletion of DINOR caused DNA damage and an upregulation of genes involved in morphogenesis, DNA damage and DNA replication. The DNA checkpoint kinase Rad53 was hyperphosphorylated in dinorΔ mutants, and deletion of RAD53 abolished DNA damage-induced filamentation. DNA-alkylating agents, which cause similar filamentous growth, induced DINOR expression, suggesting a role for DINOR in maintaining genome integrity. Upregulation of DINOR also occurred during exposure to the antifungal drugs caspofungin and amphotericin B, macrophages, H2O2 and sodium dodecylsulfate, indicating that DINOR orchestrates multiple stress responses. Consistently, dinorΔ mutants displayed increased sensitivity to these stresses and were attenuated for virulence in mice.

With reference to the behavior of neurons in real brains, the cost function was introduced in an activity-dependent form correlating the activity cost and the wiring cost as a simple ratio. Cost reduction of this ratio resulted in strengthening connections, especially at highly activated nodes, and induced the formation of large clusters. Regarding these network features, statistical similarity was confirmed by comparison to connectome datasets from various real brains.

In this paper we describe a robust platform for quantification of MB distribution in the human brain, allowing to quantitatively discriminate between tumoral and normal brain tissues and we provide new information regarding real-time cerebral MBs distribution. Intraoperative CEUS imaging was performed during surgical tumor resection using an ultrasound machine (MyLab Twice, Esaote, Italy) equipped with a multifrequency (3-11 MHz) linear array probe (LA332) and a specific low mechanical index (MI < 0.4) CEUS algorithm (CnTi, Esaote, Italy; section thickness, 0.245 cm) for non-destructive continuous MBs imaging. CEUS acquisition is started by enabling the CnTI PEN-M algorithm automatically setting the MI at 0.4 with a center frequency of 2.94 MHz-10 Hz frame rate at 80 mm-allowing for continuous non-destructive MBs imaging. 19 ultrasound image sets of adequate length were selected and retrospectively analyzed using a custom image processing software for quantitative analysis of echo power. Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn on key structures (artery-tumor-white matter) by a blinded neurosurgeon, following which peak enhancement and time intensity curves (TICs) were quantified. CEUS images revealed clear qualitative differences in MB distribution: arteries showed the earliest and highest enhancement among all structures, followed by tumor and white matter regions, respectively. The custom software built for quantitative analysis effectively captured these differences. Quantified peak intensities showed regions containing artery, tumor or white matter structures having an average MB intensity of 0.584, 0.436 and 0.175 units, respectively. Moreover, the normalized area under TICs revealed the time of flight for MB to be significantly lower in brain tissue as compared with tumor tissue. Significant heterogeneities in TICs were also observed within different regions of the same brain lesion.

In these diseases, α-synuclein forms dense intracellular aggregates that are disease hallmarks and actively contribute to tissue pathology. Interestingly, many pathological mechanisms, including iron accumulation and lipid peroxidation, are shared between classical synucleinopathies such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). However, to date, no studies have determined if α-synuclein accumulation occurs after human SCI. To examine this, cross-sections from injured and non-injured human spinal cords were immunolabeled for α-synuclein. This showed robust α-synuclein accumulation in profiles resembling axons and astrocytes in tissue surrounding the injury, revealing that α-synuclein markedly aggregates in traumatically injured human spinal cords. We also detected significant iron deposition in the injury site, a known catalyst for α-synuclein aggregation. Next a rodent SCI model mimicking the histological features of human SCI revealed aggregates and structurally altered monomers of α-synuclein are present after SCI. To determine if α-synuclein exacerbates SCI pathology, α-synuclein knockout mice were tested. Compared to wild type mice, α-synuclein knockout mice had significantly more spared axons and neurons and lower pro-inflammatory mediators, macrophage accumulation, and iron deposition in the injured spinal cord. Interestingly, locomotor analysis revealed that α-synuclein may be essential for dopamine-mediated hindlimb function after SCI. Collectively, the marked upregulation and long-lasting accumulation of α-synuclein and iron suggests that SCI may fit within the family of synucleinopathies and offer new therapeutic targets for promoting neuron preservation and improving function after spinal trauma.\n", "authors": "Andrew D Sauerbeck,Evan Z Goldstein,Anthony N Alfredo,Michael Norenberg,Alexander Marcillo,Dana M McTigue", "pmid": "34083630", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:14.074Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:14.074Z", "publish_date": "2021-06-03", "keywords": "", "slug": "alpha-synuclein-increases-in-rodent-and-human-spin", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 2089, "fields": {"title": "Connectivity adaptations in dopaminergic systems define the brain maturity of investors.", "body": "\nInvestment decisions rely on perceptions from external stimuli along with the integration of inner brain-body signals, all of which are shaped by experience.

While this disintegration is assumed to contribute to higher cognitive decline, data linking structural integrity and sensory function are sparse. The investigation of their interrelation may provide valuable insight into the mechanisms of brain aging. We used a combined behavioral and neuroimaging approach and investigated to what extent changes in microstructural white matter integrity reflect performance declines in tactile pattern recognition with aging. Poor performance in older participants was related to decreased integrity in the anterior corpus callosum. Probabilistic tractography showed that this structure is connected to the prefrontal cortices.

It was the aim of this study was to investigate the optimum duration of hypercapnia. This point is assumed to be the time at which buffer systems become active, cause an adaptation to changes of the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) and annihilate a possible therapeutic effect. In this prospective interventional study in a neurosurgical ICU the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) was increased to a target range of 55 mmHg for 120 min by modification of the respiratory minute volume (RMV) one time a day between day 4 and 14 in 12 mechanically ventilated poor-grade SAH-patients. Arterial blood gases were measured every 15 min. CBF and brain tissue oxygen saturation (StiO2) were the primary and secondary end points. Intracranial pressure (ICP) was controlled by an external ventricular drainage. Under continuous hypercapnia (PaCO2 of 53.17 ± 5.07), CBF was significantly elevated between 15 and 120 min after the start of hypercapnia. During the course of the trial intervention, cardiac output also increased significantly. To assess the direct effect of hypercapnia on brain perfusion, the increase of CBF was corrected by the parallel increase of cardiac output. The maximum direct CBF enhancing effect of hypercapnia of 32% was noted at 45 min after the start of hypercapnia. Thereafter, the CBF enhancing slowly declined. No relevant adverse effects were observed. CBF and StiO2 reproducibly increased by controlled hypercapnia in all patients. After 45 min, the curve of CBF enhancement showed an inflection point when corrected by cardiac output. It is concluded that 45 min might be the optimum duration for a therapeutic use and may provide an optimal balance between the benefits of hypercapnia and risks of a negative rebound effect after return to normal ventilation parameters.Trial registration: The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee (AZ 230/14) and registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (Trial-ID: NCT01799525).

Indeed, analysis of suitable open-access COVID-19 data in three European countries indicates that individuals in the 0-40 age interval and females under 60 are significantly less likely to develop a severe condition and die, whereas males equal or above 60 are more likely at risk of severe disease and death.

The accumulation of damaged or unfolded proteins triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR), which can act as a homeostatic response or lead to cell death. However, the factors involved in turning and adaptive response into a cell death mechanism are still not well understood. Several mechanisms leading to brain injury induced by severe hypoglycemia have been described but the contribution of the UPR has been poorly studied. Cell responses triggered during both the hypoglycemia and the glucose reinfusion periods can contribute to neuronal death. Therefore, we have investigated the activation dynamics of the PERK and the IRE1α branches of the UPR and their contribution to neuronal death in a model of glucose deprivation (GD) and glucose reintroduction (GR) in cortical neurons. Results show a rapid activation of the PERK/p-eIF2α/ATF4 pathway leading to protein synthesis inhibition during GD, which contributes to neuronal adaptation, however, sustained blockade of protein synthesis during GR promotes neuronal death. On the other hand, IRE1α activation occurs early during GD due to its interaction with BAK/BAX, while ASK1 is recruited to IRE1α activation complex during GR promoting the nuclear translocation of JNK and the upregulation of Chop. Most importantly, results show that IRE1α RNase activity towards its splicing target Xbp1 mRNA occurs late after GR, precluding a homeostatic role. Instead, IRE1α activity during GR drives neuronal death by positively regulating ASK1/JNK activity through the degradation of 14-3-3 θ mRNA, a negative regulator of ASK and an adaptor protein highly expressed in brain, implicated in neuroprotection. Collectively, results describe a novel regulatory mechanism of cell death in neurons, triggered by the downregulation of 14-3-3 θ mRNA induced by the IRE1α branch of the UPR.\n", "authors": "Juan Carlos Gómora-García,Cristian Gerónimo-Olvera,Xochitl Pérez-Martínez,Lourdes Massieu", "pmid": "34083523", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:14.095Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:14.095Z", "publish_date": "2021-06-03", "keywords": "", "slug": "ire1-ridd-activity-induced-under-er-stress-drives-", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 2096, "fields": {"title": "Psychosocial and behavioral problems of children and adolescents in the early stage of reopening schools after the COVID-19 pandemic: a national cross-sectional study in China.", "body": "\nThis study aims to explore the psychosocial and behavioral problems of children and adolescents in the early stage of reopening schools.

The SB28 mouse model of GBM responded to ICI when grown subcutaneously but not intracerebrally, providing a system to explore mechanisms underlying ICI resistance in GBM. The response to ICI in the subcutaneous SB28 model required CD4 T cells and NK cells, but not CD8 T cells.

We have previously reported that the isoform without the src homology 3 (SH3) domain, CBSH3-, is particularly active in enhancing the GABAergic postsynapse in both cultured hippocampal neurons as well as in cortical pyramidal neurons after chronic in vivo expression in in utero electroporated (IUE) rats. Deficiency of CB in knockout mice results in absence of gephyrin and gephyrin-dependent GABAARs at postsynaptic sites in several brain regions, including hippocampus. In the present study, we have generated an adeno-associated virus (AAV) that expresses CBSH3- in a cre-dependent manner. Using male and female VGLUT1-IRES-cre or VGAT-IRES-cre mice, we explore the effect of overexpression of CBSH3- in hippocampal pyramidal cells or hippocampal interneurons. The results show that: 1) the accumulation of gephyrin and GABAARs at inhibitory postsynapses in hippocampal pyramidal neurons or interneurons can be enhanced by CBSH3- overexpression, 2) overexpression of CBSH3- in hippocampal pyramidal cells can enhance the strength of inhibitory neurotransmission, and 3) these enhanced inhibitory synapses provide protection against PTZ-induced seizures. The results indicate that this AAV vector carrying CBSH3- can be used for in vivo enhancement of GABAergic synaptic transmission in selected target neurons in the brain.Significance statementExcessive or imbalanced excitation in the hippocampus can result in acute or chronic pathological conditions, such as seizures, epilepsy, and learning impairments. It is therefore important to uncover target genes that can be manipulated to restore or prevent this imbalance. This study uses a novel adeno-associated virus to express collybistin SH3- in select cells of the hippocampus. We have found that overexpression of this protein enhances GABAergic inhibitory synaptic transmission. The results also bring attention to collybistin as a possible target for therapeutic intervention aimed to restore the balance between excitation and inhibition.\nCopyright © 2021 George et al.\n", "authors": "Shanu George,Shaun James,Angel L de Blas", "pmid": "34083383", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:14.116Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:14.116Z", "publish_date": "2021-06-02", "keywords": "AAV", "slug": "selective-overexpression-of-collybistin-in-mouse-h", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 2104, "fields": {"title": "Soft-shell headgear, concussion and injury prevention in youth team collision sports: a systematic review.", "body": "\nTo assess the association between soft-shell headgear (HG) use and sports-related concussion (SRC).

To understand the impact of stimulus predictability on perception, it is important to determine how the detection of predictable structure influences processing and attention. Here we use pupillometry to gain insight into the effect of sensory regularity on arousal. Pupillometry is a commonly used measure of salience and processing effort, with more perceptually salient or perceptually demanding stimuli consistently associated with larger pupil diameters.In two experiments we tracked human listeners' pupil dynamics while they listened to sequences of 50ms tone pips of different frequencies. The order of the tone pips was either random, contained deterministic (fully predictable) regularities (experiment 1, n = 18, 11 female) or had a probabilistic regularity structure (experiment 2, n = 20, 17 female). The sequences were rapid, preventing conscious tracking of sequence structure thus allowing us to focus on the automatic extraction of different types of regularities. We hypothesized that if regularity facilitates processing by reducing processing demands, a smaller pupil diameter would be seen in response to regular relative to random patterns. Conversely, if regularity is associated with heightened arousal and attention (i.e. engages processing resources) the opposite pattern would be expected. In both experiments we observed a smaller sustained (tonic) pupil diameter for regular compared with random sequences, consistent with the former hypothesis and confirming that predictability facilitates sequence processing.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe brain is highly sensitive to auditory regularities. To appreciate the impact that the presence of predictability has on perception, we need to better understand how a predictable structure influences processing and attention. We recorded listeners' pupil responses to sequences of tones that followed either a predictable or unpredictable pattern, as the pupil can be used to implicitly tap into these different cognitive processes. We found that the pupil showed a smaller sustained diameter to predictable sequences, indicating that predictability eased processing rather than boosted attention. The findings suggest that the pupil response can be used to study the automatic extraction of regularities, and that the effects are most consistent with predictability helping the listener to efficiently process upcoming sounds.\nCopyright © 2021 Milne et al.\n", "authors": "Alice Milne,Sijia Zhao,Christina Tampakaki,Gabriela Bury,Maria Chait", "pmid": "34083259", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:14.133Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:14.133Z", "publish_date": "2021-06-01", "keywords": "", "slug": "sustained-pupil-responses-are-modulated-by-predict", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 2110, "fields": {"title": "Developmental and interventional plasticity of motor maps after perinatal stroke.", "body": "\nWithin the perinatal stroke field, there is a need to establish preclinical models where putative biomarkers for motor function can be examined. In a mouse model of perinatal stroke, we evaluated motor map size and movement latency following optogenetic cortical stimulation against three factors of post-stroke biomarker utility: 1) Correlation to chronic impairment on a behavioral test battery; 2) Amenability to change using a skilled motor training paradigm; 3) Ability to distinguish individuals with potential to respond well to training. Thy1-ChR2-YFP mice received a photothrombotic stroke at postnatal day 7 and were evaluated on a battery of motor tests between days 59-70. Following a cranial window implant, mice underwent longitudinal optogenetic motor mapping both before and after 3 weeks of skilled forelimb training. Map size and movement latency of both hemispheres was positively correlated with impaired spontaneous forelimb use, whereas only ipsilesional hemisphere map size was correlated with performance in skilled reaching. Map size and movement latency did not show groupwise changes with training; however, mice with the smallest pre-training map sizes and worst impairments demonstrated the greatest expansion of map size in response to skilled forelimb training. Overall, motor map size showed utility as a potential biomarker for impairment and training-induced modulation in specific individuals. Future assessment of the predictive capacity of post-stroke motor representations for behavioral outcome in animal models opens the possibility of dissecting how plasticity mechanisms contribute to recovery following perinatal stroke.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTWe investigated the utility of two cortical motor representation measures (motor map size and movement onset latency) as potential biomarkers for post-stroke motor recovery in a mouse model of perinatal stroke. Both motor map size and movement latency were associated with functional recovery after perinatal stroke, with map size showing an additional association between training responsiveness and severity of impairment. Overall, both motor map size and movement onset latency show potential as neurophysiological correlates of recovery. As such, future studies of perinatal stroke rehabilitation and neuromodulation should include these measures in order to help explain neurophysiological changes that might be occurring in response to treatment.\nCopyright © 2021 the authors.\n", "authors": "Sarah Y Zhang,Matthew S Jeffers,Diane C Lagace,Adam Kirton,Gergely Silasi", "pmid": "34083257", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:14.136Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:14.136Z", "publish_date": "2021-06-01", "keywords": "", "slug": "developmental-and-interventional-plasticity-of-mot", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 2111, "fields": {"title": "Inflammation-Induced Histamine Impairs the Capacity of Escitalopram to Increase Hippocampal Extracellular Serotonin.", "body": "\nCommonly prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) inhibit the serotonin transporter to correct a presumed deficit in extracellular serotonin signaling during depression. These agents bring clinical relief to many who take them, however a significant, and growing number of individuals are resistant to SSRIs. There is emerging evidence that inflammation plays a significant role in the clinical variability of SSRIs, though how SSRIs and inflammation intersect with synaptic serotonin modulation remains unknown. In this work, we employ fast in vivo serotonin measurement tools to investigate the nexus between serotonin, inflammation, and SSRIs. Upon acute, systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration in male and female mice, we find robust decreases in extracellular serotonin in the mouse hippocampus. We show these decreased serotonin levels are supported by increased histamine activity (due to inflammation), acting on inhibitory histamine H3 heteroreceptors on serotonin terminals. Importantly, under LPS-induced histamine increases, the ability of escitalopram to increase extracellular serotonin is impaired due to an off-target action of escitalopram to inhibit histamine reuptake. Finally, we show that a functional decrease in histamine synthesis boosts the ability of escitalopram to increase extracellular serotonin levels following LPS. This work reveals a profound effect of inflammation on brain chemistry, specifically the rapidity of inflammation-induced decreased extracellular serotonin, and points the spotlight at a potentially critical player in the pathology of depression, histamine. The serotonin/histamine homeostasis thus, may be a crucial new avenue in improving serotonin-based treatments for depression.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT:Acute LPS-induced inflammation 1) increases in CNS histamine, 2) decreases CNS serotonin (via inhibitory histamine receptors), and 3) prevents an SSRI from effectively increasing extracellular serotonin.

Methodological limitations are largely to blame for the imprecise mapping of function to structure in the ATL. There are two major obstacles to using fMRI to identify the precise functional organization of the ATL: the difficult choice of stimuli and tasks to activate, and dissociate, specific regions within the ATL and poor signal quality due to magnetic field distortions near the sinuses. To circumvent these difficulties, we developed a data-driven parcellation routine using resting-state fMRI data (24 females, 64 males) acquired using a sequence that was optimized to enhance signal in the ATL. Focusing on patterns of functional connectivity between each ATL voxel and the rest of the brain, we found that the ATL comprises at least 34 distinct functional parcels that are arranged into bands along the lateral and ventral cortical surfaces, extending from the posterior temporal lobes into the temporal poles. In addition, the anterior region of the fusiform gyrus, most often cited as the location of the semantic hub, was found to be part of a domain-specific network associated with face and social processing, rather than a domain-general semantic hub. These findings offer a fine-grained functional map of the ATL and offer an initial step towards using more precise language to describe the locations of functional responses in this heterogeneous region of human cortex.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe functional role of the anterior aspects of the temporal lobes (ATL) is a contentious issue. While it is likely that different regions within the ATL subserve unique cognitive functions, most studies revert to vaguely referring to particular functional regions as \"the ATL\" and, thus, the mapping of function to anatomy remains unclear. We used resting-state fMRI connectivity patterns between the ATL and the rest of the brain to reveal that the ATL comprises at least 34 distinct functional parcels that are organized into a three-level functional hierarchy. These results provide a detailed functional map of the anterior temporal lobes that can guide future research on how distinct regions within the ATL support diverse cognitive functions.\nCopyright © 2021 the authors.\n", "authors": "Andrew S Persichetti,Joseph M Denning,Stephen J Gotts,Alex Martin", "pmid": "34083253", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:14.142Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:14.142Z", "publish_date": "2021-06-01", "keywords": "", "slug": "a-data-driven-functional-mapping-of-the-anterior-t", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 2113, "fields": {"title": "A high-density narrow-field inhibitory retinal interneuron with direct coupling to Müller glia.", "body": "\nAmacrine cells are interneurons composing the most diverse cell class in the mammalian retina.

Our data also indicate that MACs release glycine at conventional chemical synapses, and viral retrograde transsynaptic tracing from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) showed selective connections between MACs and a subpopulation of RGC types. Visually-evoked responses revealed a strong preference for light increments; these \"ON\" responses were primarily mediated by excitatory chemical synaptic input and direct electrical coupling with other cells. This initial characterization of the MAC provides the first evidence for neuron-glia coupling in the mammalian retina and identifies the MAC as a potential link between inhibitory processing and glial function.Significance Statement:Gap junctions between pairs of neurons or glial cells are commonly found throughout the nervous system and play multiple roles, including electrical coupling and metabolic exchange. In contrast, gap junctions between neurons and glia cells have rarely been reported and are poorly understood. Here we report the first evidence for neuron-glia coupling in the mammalian retina, specifically between an abundant (but previously unstudied) inhibitory interneuron and Müller glia. Moreover, viral tracing, optogenetics and serial electron microscopy provide new information about the neuron's synaptic partners and physiological responses.\nCopyright © 2021 the authors.\n", "authors": "William N Grimes,Didem Göz Aytürk,Mrinalini Hoon,Takeshi Yoshimatsu,Clare Gamlin,Daniel Carrera,Amurta Nath,Francisco M Nadal-Nicolás,Richard M Ahlquist,Adit Sabnis,David M Berson,Jeffrey S Diamond,Rachel O Wong,Connie Cepko,Fred Rieke", "pmid": "34083252", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:14.145Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:14.145Z", "publish_date": "2021-06-01", "keywords": "", "slug": "a-high-density-narrow-field-inhibitory-retinal-int", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 2114, "fields": {"title": "Risk factors for adverse outcomes among 35 879 veterans with and without diabetes after diagnosis with COVID-19.", "body": "\nRisk factors and mediators of associations of diabetes with COVID-19 outcomes are unclear.\nWe identified all veterans receiving Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare with ≥1 positive nasal swab for SARS-CoV-2 (28 February-31 July 2020; n=35 879).

During door-to-door visits, trained fieldworkers used a validated questionnaire to interview consenting household heads to screen for epilepsy in eligible residents. Trained physicians subsequently assessed people with suspected seizures. After clinical assessment, they confirmed or refuted the diagnosis and estimated the date of epilepsy onset. A trained nurse interviewed people with epilepsy and randomly selected healthy individuals, obtaining relevant demographic details and information on exposure to risk factors for epilepsy. Out of 36,282 residents screened, 524 had active epilepsy. The age-standardized prevalence of active epilepsy was 33.9/1,000 (95% CI: 31.0-37.1/1,000). We estimated the one-year age-standardized epilepsy incidence at 171/100,000 (95%CI: 114.0-254.6). Active epilepsy prevalence varied widely between health areas, ranging between 12 and 75 per 1,000. The peak age-specific prevalence was in the 25-34 age group. In adults, multivariate analysis showed that having a relative with epilepsy was positively associated with epilepsy. Epilepsy characteristics in this population, geographical heterogeneity, and the age-specific prevalence pattern suggest that endemic neurocysticercosis and onchocerciasis may be implicated.

In all mammals, including humans, the radial glia lining the ventricles of the embryonic telencephalon, more recently reclassified as apical radial glia (aRGs), have been identified as the neural progenitors giving rise to all excitatory neurons and inhibitory interneurons of the six-layered cortex. In this review, we explore the fundamental molecular and cellular mechanisms that regulate aRG function and the generation of neuronal diversity in the dorsal telencephalon. We survey the key structural features essential for the retention of the highly polarized aRG morphology and therefore impose aRG identity after cytokinesis. We discuss how these structures and associated molecular signaling complexes influence aRG proliferative capacity and the decision to undergo proliferative self-renewing symmetric or neurogenic asymmetric divisions. We also explore the intriguing and complex question of how the extensive neuronal diversity within the adult neocortex arises from the small aRG population located within the cortical proliferative zone. We further highlight the recent clonal lineage tracing and single-cell transcriptomic profiling studies providing compelling evidence that individual neuronal identity emerges as a consequence of exposure to temporally regulated extrinsic cues which coordinate waves of transcriptional activity that evolve over time to drive neuronal commitment and maturation.\nCopyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

The results of cell viability, neurite elongation, SC function and maturation, SC-axon interaction, and myelination were compared with two other commonly used substrates, namely collagen and Poly-d Lysine (PDL). The tuned GelMA constructs (Young's modulus of 32.6 ± 1.9 kPa and the median value of pore size of 10.3 μm) enhanced single axon generation (unlike collagen) and promoted the interaction of DRG neurons and SCs (unlike PDL). While DRG cells exhibited relatively higher viability on PDL after 48 h, i.e., 83.8%, the cells had similar survival rate on GelMA and collagen substrates, 66.7% and 61.5%, respectively. Further adjusting the hydrogel properties to achieve two distinct ranges of relatively small and large pores supported SCs to extend their processes freely and enabled physical contact with and wrapping around their corresponding axons. Staining the cells with myelin basic protein (MBA) and myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) revealed enhanced myelination on GelMA hydrogel compared to PDL and collagen. Moreover, the engineered porosity enhanced DRGs and SCs attachments and flexibility of movement across the substrate. This engineered hydrogel structure can now be further explored to model demyelination in neurodegenerative diseases, as well as to study the effects of various compounds on myelin regeneration.\nCopyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Notably, our live cell imaging data demonstrate that microglia, when attached to the cell membrane of an astrocyte, can attract and clear intracellular protein deposits from the astrocyte.\nTaken together, our data demonstrate the importance of astrocyte and microglia interactions in Aβ/αSYN clearance, highlighting the relevance of glial cellular crosstalk in the progression of AD- and PD-related brain pathology.\n", "authors": "Jinar Rostami,Tobias Mothes,Mahshad Kolahdouzan,Olle Eriksson,Mohsen Moslem,Joakim Bergström,Martin Ingelsson,Paul O'Callaghan,Luke M Healy,Anna Falk,Anna Erlandsson", "pmid": "34082772", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:14.189Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:14.189Z", "publish_date": "2021-06-03", "keywords": "Alzheimer’s disease", "slug": "crosstalk-between-astrocytes-and-microglia-results", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 2129, "fields": {"title": "Age influences susceptibility of brain capillary endothelial cells to La Crosse virus infection and cell death.", "body": "\nA key factor in the development of viral encephalitis is a virus crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We have previously shown that age-related susceptibility of mice to the La Crosse virus (LACV), the leading cause of pediatric arbovirus encephalitis in the USA, was associated with the ability of the virus to cross the BBB. LACV infection in weanling mice (aged around 3 weeks) results in vascular leakage in the olfactory bulb/tract (OB/OT) region of the brain, which is not observed in adult mice aged > 6-8 weeks. Thus, we studied age-specific differences in the response of brain capillary endothelial cells (BCECs) to LACV infection.\nTo examine mechanisms of LACV-induced BBB breakdown and infection of the CNS, we analyzed BCECs directly isolated from weanling and adult mice as well as established a model where these cells were infected in vitro and cultured for a short period to determine susceptibility to virus infection and cell death. Additionally, we utilized correlative light electron microscopy (CLEM) to examine whether changes in cell morphology and function were also observed in BCECs in vivo.\nBCECs from weanling, but not adult mice, had detectable infection after several days in culture when taken ex vivo from infected mice suggesting that these cells could be infected in vitro. Further analysis of BCECs from uninfected mice, infected in vitro, showed that weanling BCECs were more susceptible to virus infection than adult BCECs, with higher levels of infected cells, released virus as well as cytopathic effects (CPE) and cell death. Although direct LACV infection is not detected in the weanling BCECs, CLEM analysis of brain tissue from weanling mice indicated that LACV infection induced significant cerebrovascular damage which allowed virus-sized particles to enter the brain parenchyma.\nThese findings indicate that BCECs isolated from adult and weanling mice have differential viral load, infectivity, and susceptibility to LACV. These age-related differences in susceptibility may strongly influence LACV-induced BBB leakage and neurovascular damage allowing virus invasion of the CNS and the development of neurological disease.\n", "authors": "Rahul Basu,Vinod Nair,Clayton W Winkler,Tyson A Woods,Iain D C Fraser,Karin E Peterson", "pmid": "34082753", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:14.192Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:14.192Z", "publish_date": "2021-06-03", "keywords": "Blood-brain barrier", "slug": "age-influences-susceptibility-of-brain-capillary-e", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 2130, "fields": {"title": "Differences in cause and 12-month follow-up outcome of parkinsonian symptoms in depressed older adults treated with antipsychotics: a case series.", "body": "\nParkinsonian symptoms are common adverse effects of antipsychotics.

Neuroscientific models of pathological aging emphasize the loss of sensorimotor stimulation and reduced neuromodulatory capacities as core processes in age-related cognitive and bodily decline, which may be associated with maladaptive plastic changes in the brain. We plan to increase sensorimotor stimulation in frail persons through a newly developed app-based training program and link the training trials to biological and psychological correlates of age-associated vulnerability and health indices.\nWe will conduct a randomized trial, applying an app-based sensorimotor home training (N = 30) in people suffering from frailty. An app-based relaxation training will serve as an active control condition (N = 30). Both interventions will last for 90 days each. The sensorimotor training includes unimodal and multimodal sensory discrimination tasks in the visual, auditory, and tactile domain, as well as sensorimotor precision tasks. The tasks will be implemented using an adaptive training algorithm and enriched with motivational components embedded in a virtual training environment. We expect a pre-post reduction of frailty status and associated functional decline related to refinement of representational maps within the sensorimotor system and improved sensorimotor function such as extremity function. Secondary analyses will study the influence of BDNF genotype as moderating variable. Additional outcomes will include measures of perceptual and cognitive functioning, quality of life as well as BDNF serum levels. Measurements will take place before training (baseline), after 60 days (assessment 1), and at the end of the training after 90 days (assessment 2).\nIn our randomized trial, we aim to characterize a multidimensional concept of frailty and to target maladaptive behaviors and neuroplasticity using an app-based sensorimotor training.

It also was demonstrated that the T3-mediated development of an early neuronal network is characteristic for depolarizing GABAergic neurons concomitant with intracellular calcium transients. An important aspect of T3-dependent regulation of gene expression in the developing brain is its modulation by the transcription activator COUP-TF1. Regulation of alternative splicing by CaMKIV is another important aspect for embryonal neural development since it can lead to the expression of PMCA1a, the neuronal specific isoform of the plasma membrane calcium pump.

All patients underwent bimanual gynecological examination, ultrasound and MRI to determine the condition of the pelvic organs, assess the structure, location, number of myomas, as well as assess the possible acoustic pathway of high-intensity focused ultrasound. During monitoring, dynamic contrasting was used to determine the zone of node necrosis. Methods of control in the postoperative period: ultrasound, MRI of the pelvic organs using paramagnetic, were performed after 1, 3, 6 months. Ultrasound ablation of uterine fibroids was performed using the JC extracorporeal treatment system (Chongqing HAIFU (HIFU) Technology Co. Ltd., China) with a built-in ultrasound system (Italy). Controlling the direct result was based on gray scale changes during real-time ultrasound examination on the monitor of the JC device. Since HIFU is a non-invasive method of treatment, in the future, the diagnosis was limited to using the ultrasound and MRI paramagnetic. Indicators such as: uterine body size were considered as indicators that characterize the effectiveness of treatment; specific volume of myoma; regression of uterine body size; regression of the myoma; regression of the node, calculated on its specific volume, because one patient could have several nodes.\nResults: Analyzing the obtained results, it should be noted that for a month the average volume of leiomatous hives that were exposed to HIFU, almost did not change and was 122 cm³, while three months after treatment it was - 98 cm. The nodes underwent a significant reduction 6 months after the treatment, their volume averaged 61 cm³. The dynamics analysis results of uterine body volume reduction, which is no less important expected result, showed the following: in the first month after the intervention the uterine volume almost did not change and, compared to the average size before treatment 342cm³, was 300cm³. In three months after treatment, the body volume of the uterus decreased to 264 cm³, and in six months - to 200 cm³. When assessing the node 6 months after the procedure, it was found that during this period there was a significant reduction in the volume of leiomyoma, which was positively correlated with the clinical manifestations of the disease.\nConclusions: An interdisciplinary approach with the widespread introduction of modern organ-preserving techniques is an important direction in maintaining the reproductive health of women with uterine leiomyoma. Positive dynamics of leiomatous node volume regression depends on its location, volume and MR type. The terms 1 and 3 months after ultrasound ablation are insufficient for objective radiological evaluation of the treatment outcome, but are important for the choice of further tactics in observing and treating the uterine leiomyoma.\n", "authors": "Iryna Yu Karacharova,Tetiana M Kozarenko,Maya A Flaksemberg,Alla G Kornatska,Valentyna K Kondratiuk,Iryna M Nikitina", "pmid": "34090282", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:25.062Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:25.062Z", "publish_date": null, "keywords": " hysterectomy ", "slug": "interdisciplinary-interaction-in-maintaining-the-r", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 2143, "fields": {"title": "The Utilization and Impact of Aromatase Inhibitor Therapy in Men With Elevated Estradiol Levels on Testosterone Therapy.", "body": "\nTestosterone therapy (TTH) for testosterone deficiency (TD) may lead to elevated estradiol (E2) levels requiring management to avoid unnecessary adverse effects.\nTo examine the impact of aromatase inhibitors, specifically anastrozole (AZ), in men with elevated E2 on TTH.\nAll patients on TTH at a high volume sexual medicine practice between 2005 and 2019 were reviewed.

The Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM), a novel consensus for the diagnosis of malnutrition, was proposed recently. However, the roles of GLIM in diagnosing malnutrition and predicting overall survival (OS) in patients with GC have been unclear.\nWe conducted a multicenter, observational cohort study including 877 hospitalized patients with GC 2013 through 2018. Different anthropometric measurements were compared to assess reduced muscle mass. Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariate Cox regression were used to analyze the relationship between GLIM-defined malnutrition and the OS of patients with GC. Independent prognostic variables were incorporated to develop a nomogram for individualized survival prediction. The calibration curve was used to determine the predictive accuracy and discriminatory capacity of the nomogram. In addition, 219 patients with GC were enrolled for external validation.\nA total of 464 (53%) patients with GC were diagnosed with malnutrition. Patients diagnosed with severe malnutrition based on either midarm circumference or body weight-standardized hand grip strength had a shorter median survival time (16.7 mo; interquartile range, 8.4-32.7 mo) and a higher hazard ratio (HR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.15-1.92; P = 0.002).

We previously showed that claudin-1 is aberrantly expressed from an early stage of uterine cervical adenocarcinoma and contributes to malignant potentials. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying tumor-promoting roles of claudin-1, we established and analyzed claudin-1 knockout cells. Knockout of claudin-1 suppressed conventional tight junctional functions, barrier and fence functions, and expression of cell adhesion-associated proteins including E-cadherin. Comparative proteome analysis revealed that expression of claudin-1 affected expression of a wide range of proteins, especially proteins that are associated with cell adhesion and actin cytoskeleton remodeling. Interactome analysis of the identified proteins revealed that E-cadherin and focal adhesion kinase play central roles in the claudin-1-dependently affected protein network. Moreover, knockout of claudin-1 significantly suppressed microvilli formation and activity of Ezrin/Radixin/Moesin. Taken together, the results indicate that expression of claudin-1 affects not only conventional tight junction function but also expression and activity of a wide range of proteins, especially proteins that are associated with cell adhesion and actin cytoskeleton remodeling, to contribute to malignant potentials and microvilli formation in cervical adenocarcinoma cells.\nCopyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Studies of nilotinib-associated atherosclerosis are mainly associated with progressive peripheral artery occlusive disease (PAOD), and only a few cases of coronary artery disease (CAD), and cerebrovascular disease (CVD) have been reported. The mechanisms by which nilotinib promotes atherosclerosis are poorly understood but endothelial and perivascular factors, mast cell depletion, and metabolic factors such as promotion of dyslipidemia and impaired glucose metabolism are thought to play a role. We present a case of a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) treated with nilotinib who developed intracranial atherosclerosis leading to acute onset of stroke. Our patient had no cardiovascular risk factors prior to treatment with nilotinib and developed accelerated atheromatous cerebrovascular disease with severe left middle cerebral artery (MCA) stenosis. These findings suggest that nilotinib may be associated with the development of intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) independently of any preexisting vascular risk factors leading to acute stroke. Clinicians should have increased awareness of the association between nilotinib and the development of progressive atheromatous disease and vascular adverse events including PAOD, CAD, and CVD. In certain patients, these events can be severe and life threatening.

The acpcPNA was covalently immobilized onto partially oxidized cellulose paper via reductive alkylation between the amine and the aldehyde groups. The fluorescence-based detection was performed by monitoring the fluorescence signal response of a fluorescent dye that selectively binds to the single-strand region of the DNA target over the PNA probe employing a custom-made portable fluorescent camera gadget in combination with a smartphone camera. Under the optimal conditions, a linear relationship between the fluorescence change in the green channel and the amount of HCV DNA from 5 to 100 pmol with a correlation coefficient of 0.9956, and the limit of detection of 5 pmol were obtained for short synthetic oligonucleotides. The acpcPNA probe exhibited very high selectivity for the complementary oligonucleotides over the single-base-mismatched, two-base-mismatched, and non-complementary DNA targets. Benefitting from the signal amplification achieved through the numerous binding sites for the dye provided by the overhanging tail of long ssDNA target sequences, this system was successfully applied to detect the HCV complementary DNA (cDNA) obtained from clinical samples with satisfactory results.

The most commonly used questionnaire was the PedsQL™ (32.8%), followed by the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System scales (12.1%). No association was observed between the use of PROs and trial region, number of centres, trial phase, time period or intervention type (all p > .05). The use of PROs did not substantially increase over time. Only 20.3% of the closed studies had published their results.\nDespite recommendations of regulatory agencies, PRO assessment is extremely rare in paediatric oncology clinical trials. More efforts should be undertaken to facilitate implementation of PRO in paediatric trials to guarantee patient-centred research and treatments.\nCopyright © 2021 The Authors.

The prognostic value for distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS) and invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) was assessed using Cox proportional hazards models and Kaplan-Meier analysis. All statistical tests were two-sided ones.\nOMm and OM (both with likelihood ratio statistic [LRS] P < 0.001; C indexes = 0.84 and 0.85, respectively) were more prognostic for DRFS and provided significant additional prognostic information to all other assessment tools/factors assessed (all LRS P ≤ 0.002). In addition, the OM correctly classified more patients with distant recurrences (DRs) into the high-risk category than other risk classification tools. Similar results were observed for IDFS.\nBoth OncoMasTR scores were significantly prognostic for DRFS and IDFS and provided additional prognostic information to the molecular and clinicopathological risk factors/tools assessed. OM was also the most accurate risk classification tool for identifying DR. A concise 6-gene signature with superior risk stratification was shown to increase prognosis reliability, which may help clinicians optimise treatment decisions.\nCopyright © 2021 The Authors.

However, evidence comparing Black survivors' psychological symptoms with their White counterparts has been mixed. Prior studies have not compared Black and White survivor's distress-related symptom trajectories from pre- to post-treatment - the goal of the current study.\nAt three annual visits from shortly after diagnosis to 6 and 18 months post-treatment, 195 women (n = 163 White; n = 32 Black) reported their cancer-related distress (intrusive thoughts and avoidance), perceived stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms, fatigue, and pain.\nAdjusting for age, educational attainment, income, treatment type, stage at diagnosis, and physical comorbidities, Black and White breast cancer survivors had different trajectories of cancer-related distress (p = .004), intrusive thoughts about cancer diagnosis and treatment (p = .002), perceived stress (p = .04), emotional fatigue (p = .01), and vigor (p = .02). Specifically, among White women, these distress-related symptoms improved from diagnosis to 6 months post-treatment (ps < 0.0001) and then remained stable between 6 and 18 months post-treatment, whereas Black women had persistently elevated distress - even 18 months after finishing treatment. Additionally, Black women reported more avoidance of cancer-related thoughts and emotions across visits (p = .047). Race was unrelated to the trajectories of anxiety and depressive symptoms, other fatigue subscales, or pain levels (ps > 0.08).\nLongitudinal assessment of the same breast cancer survivors from diagnosis to early survivorship revealed that Black and White survivors had divergent trajectories of psychological distress symptoms that were not reliably evident at a single timepoint. Overall, White women reported less psychological distress from pre- to post-treatment, but Black women's distress remained high from diagnosis to 18 months post-treatment. If left untreated, Black women's high distress levels may contribute to their poorer health throughout survivorship.\nCopyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

There has been comparatively little exploration of how choice is negotiated and made meaningful under the spectre of incurability and a contracted future. In this paper, drawing on multiple qualitative interviews with 38 women with metastatic breast cancer, we explore how they experience and give meaning to choice in relation to their health (and beyond) in their daily lives. Our analysis highlights that while exercising choice was sometimes a concealed or silent pursuit, choice was always a socially negotiated and temporally unfolding process, nested within relational and interpersonal dynamics. Choices were also often constrained, even foreclosed, due to situational and relational dynamics. Yet even in the absence of choice, the idea of choice-as-control was discursively embraced by women. We argue that greater attention is needed to the affective, temporal and economic dimensions of choice, and how treatment decisions are asymmetrically structured when considered within the normative context of cancer.\nCopyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

To address this critical issue, for the first time we demonstrate that a near-infrared (NIR) pulse laser can guide efficient delivery of miRNAs mediated by a NIR-absorbing and photoacoustic active semiconducting polymer (SP) nanocarrier, which can generate photoacoustic radiation force to intravascularly overcome the endothelial barriers. Importantly, we demonstrate an ultrafast delivery of miRNA (miR-7) to tumor tissues under the irradiation of pulse laser in 20 min, showing a 5-fold boosted efficiency in comparison to the traditional passive targeting strategy. The delivered miR-7 acts as a sensitizer of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and synergizes with TRAIL-inducing compound (TIC), leading to sustained TRAIL upregulation for effective tumor suppression in mice. As such, our results indicate that the NIR-absorbing semiconducting polymer-mediated nanocarrier platform can significantly enhance the targeted delivery efficiency of therapeutic miRNAs to tumors, resulting in potent tumor growth inhibition.\nCopyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we hypothesize that targeting the CD146 with low-dose gold nanorods combined with mild hyperthermia can stop the migration of these cancer cells. Two metastatic cancer cells including a melanoma and a breast cancer cell line are selected as the model systems. Cell migration assays show that the migration of both cell lines can be completely stopped by the treatment. Atomic force microscopy and super resolution fluorescence microscopy reveal the alterations of actin cytoskeleton and cell morphology correspond to the inhibited cell migration. Further mechanistic analysis indicates the treatment disrupts the actin cytoskeleton by a synergistic mechanism including depleting membrane CD146 and interfering ezrin-radixin-moesin phosphorylation. As a result, we believe targeting CD146 with low-dose gold nanorods and mild hyperthermia could be a versatile, effective, and safe approach for stopping cancer metastasis. More broadly, the concept of targeting cancer cell surface markers that connect the underlying actin cytoskeleton, offers enormous potential in treating cancer metastasis, which accounts for more than 90% of cancer-associated mortality.\nCopyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Protonectin (PTN), a cationic dodecapeptide of pharmacological interest, presents large hydrophobicity that is associated with the tendency to aggregate and supposedly influences bioactivity. A disaggregating role was assigned to PTN' N-terminal fragment (PTN1-6), which enhances the bioactivity of PTN in a 1:1 mixture (PTN/PTN1-6). Spectroscopic techniques and model membranes (phospholipid bilayers and SDS micelles) revealed that environment-dependent aggregation is reduced for PTN/PTN1-6, but cytotoxicity of PTNs on MDA-MB-231 breast cancer showed the same CC50 values around 16 µM and on MCF-10A epithelial breast cells 6 to 5-fold higher values, revealing a selective interaction. Since PTN1-6 lacks activity on breast cells, its presence should differently affect PTN activity, suggesting that aggregation could modulate activity depending on the membrane characteristics. Indeed, increased partitioning and lytic activity of PTN/PTN1-6 were found in model membranes independently of charge density, but affected by the curvature tendency. PTN and PTN/PTN1-6 do not alter morphology and roughness of cancer cells, indicating a superficial interaction with membranes and consistent with results obtained in NMR experiments. Our results indicate that aggregation of PTNs depends on the membrane characteristics and modulates the activity of the peptides.\nCopyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

In contrast, deep learning architectures provide better detection by extracting the different properties of polyps. However, the desired success has not yet been achieved in real-time polyp detection. Here, we propose a new structure for real-time polyp detection by scaling the YOLOv4 algorithm to overcome these obstacles. For this, we first replace the whole structure with Cross Stage Partial Networks (CSPNet), then substitute the Mish activation function for the Leaky ReLu activation function and also substituted the Distance Intersection over Union (DIoU) loss for the Complete Intersection over Union (CIoU) loss. We improved performance of YOLOv3 and YOLOv4 architectures using different structures such as ResNet, VGG, DarkNet53, and Transformers. To increase success of the proposed method, we utilized a variety of data augmentation approaches for preprocessing, an ensemble learning model, and NVIDIA TensorRT for post processing. In order to compare our study with other studies more objectively, we only employed public data sets and followed MICCAI Sub-Challenge on Automatic Polyp Detection in Colonoscopy.

In this study, we explored whether the 8-methoxy-2-methylquinoline moiety and bicyclic aromatic rings at the N'-methylene position were critical for their antitumor activity against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). For this purpose, a small library of 5-substituted 1H-indole-2-carbohydrazide derivatives was designed and synthesized. We found that the 8-methoxy-2-methylquinoline moiety was a fundamental structure for its biological function, while the introduction of the bicyclic aromatic ring into the N'-methylene greatly improved its anti-tumor effect. We found that the representative compound 10E had a high affinity to Nur77. The KD values were in the low micromolar (2.25-4.10 μM), which were coincident with its IC50 values against the tumor cell lines (IC50 < 3.78 μM). Compound 10E could induce autophagic cell death of liver cancer cells by targeting Nur77 to mitochondria while knocking down Nur77 greatly impaired anti-tumor effect. These findings provide an insight into the structure-activity relation of Quinoline-Indole-Schiff base derivatives and further demonstrate that antitumor agents targeting Nur77 may be considered as a promising strategy for HCC therapy.\nCopyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

We included the patients who had been treated in thrombosis clinic from 2006 to 2018 for symptomatic SVT of the legs, either isolated SVT or SVT complicated with concurrent DVT/PE. We evaluated the prevalence and type of malignancy (diagnosed in 12 months prior to SVT and/or ongoing therapy), demographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients. For statistical evaluation, we used Student's t-test, the Kruskal-Wallis test, Fisher exact two-sided test T-test, and logistic regression.\nOf 276 patients with SVT (mean age 58.9±14.7 years; 60.9% females), 191 had isolated SVT and 85 SVT complicated by concurrent DVT/PE. The prevalence of malignancy was 8.7% in the whole group (mainly breast and urinary tract cancer); 4.2% in those with isolated SVT and 18.8% in SVT with concurrent DVT/PE (P<0.001). Between the two subgroups, there were no significant differences in duration of leg symptoms, family or personal history of SVT/DVT, SVT location, and smoking. In logistic regression, several factors were significantly associated with concurrent presence of DVT/PE: age (odds ratio OR 1.024, 95% confidential interval CI 1.004-1.044); female gender (OR 0.545, 95%CI 0.309-0.960); varicose vein SVT (OR 0.42; 95%CI 0.194-0.902); thrombophilia (OR 1.939; 95%CI 1.089-3.454); cancer (OR 4.727; 95%CI 1.814-12.316).\nThe prevalence of malignancy in the patients with SVT was 8.7%.

The objective of this study is to determine the prevalence, treatment strategies, complications and outcomes of UE-DVT.\nThis is a retrospective single-institution study of patients diagnosed with UE-DVT between January 2016 through February 2018 (26 months). Patients 18 years and older, admitted to the hospital who had a positive upper extremity duplex ultrasound for an acute UE-DVT were included in the study. The outcomes were in-hospital mortality, major bleeding, pulmonary embolism and recurrent UE-DVT.\nAmong 63,045 patients admitted to the hospital, 1,000 (1.6%) patients were diagnosed with UE-DVT. From 3,695 upper-extremity venous duplex ultrasound performed during the study period, almost one third (27.0%) were positive for an acute UE-DVT. The mean age was 55.0±17.2 years, the majority were male (58.3%), Caucasians (49.2%) and overweight (mean BMI 29.4±10.3 Kg/m2). The most affected vein was the right internal jugular (54.8%). Most of the patients (96.9%) were on venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis or anticoagulation at the time of diagnosis. The majority of patients (77.8%) had an intravenous device (IVD) at the time of the diagnosis. Most of the patients (84.4%) were treated with anticoagulation in the hospital but only half (54.5%) were discharged on anticoagulation. In-hospital mortality was 12.1% unrelated to UE-DVT, major bleeding occurred in 47.6% of the patients during hospitalization (fatal bleeding=1%), pulmonary embolism was diagnosed in 4.8% of patients, and 0.7% were fatal. Recurrent UE-DVT occurred in 6.1% of the patients. In a multivariable analysis, the risk of death was increased by older age, cancer, admission to an intensive care unit, concomitant lower extremity DVT (LE-DVT), and bleeding prior to the UE-DVT diagnosis, while the presence of an IVD increased the risk of PE. The risk of recurrent UE-DVT was increased by the presence of an IVD. The risk of major bleeding was increased by the presence of an IVD, in female patients and those with a concomitant LE-DVT.\nUpper-extremity DVT is a common complication in hospitalized patients (1.6%). Consequent acute PE and recurrent DVT remain important complications, as does bleeding. It is unclear if standard thromboprophylaxis effectively protects against UE-DVT. More studies dedicated to UE-DVT are required to provide appropriate guidance on prophylaxis and treatment.\nCopyright © 2021.

The methylation specific PCR (MSP) analysis presented a relatively hypermethylated status of THSZ3 promoter in CRC samples. The data of MSP and bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP) also confirmed that CpG sites of TSHZ3 promoter were methylated in CRC cells, and the DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza) could effectively restored the TSHZ3 expression in vitro. Functionally, the proliferation, apoptosis and metastasis of CRC cells were regulated by TSZH3 over-expression, and the suppressing effects of TSHZ3 in CRC were also confirmed in a xenograft mouse model.\nOur results indicated that promoter methylation was one of the mechanisms contributing to the down-regulation of TSHZ3 in CRC, and TSZH3 might served as a potential tumor suppressor gene in the development and progression of CRC.\nCopyright © 2021.

The complexity of this disease requires a strategy to address the net effects of both inflammation and impaired bone formation. microRNA-based gene therapy provides several therapeutic advantages to tackle these issues. Herein, we describe a microRNA-21 (miR-21) delivery system with an additional therapeutic effect from that of the delivery carrier itself. Poly (salicylic acid) (PSA) is, for the first time, synthesized via polycondensation of salicylic acid (SA), a bioactive ingredient widely used for anti-inflammation in medicine. PSA can self-assemble into nanoparticles (PSA-NPs) and can effectively deliver genes both in vitro and in vivo. The carrier was then attached to repetitive sequences of aspartate, serine, serine (DSS)6 for delivering miRNAs specifically to bone-formation surfaces. In vitro studies showed that miR-21@PSA-NP could effectively realize the intracellular delivery of miR-21 with low toxicity, while in vivo results indicated that the miR-21@PSA-NP-DSS6 prolonged blood circulation time, enhanced bone accumulation, and significantly improved the efficacy of miR-21-based bone anabolic therapy in osteoporotic mice. The constructed delivery system (miR-21@PSA-NP-DSS6) inherited the advantages of both SA and miR-21, which could ameliorate bone-inflamed niche and rescued the impaired bone formation ability. The synergy of anti-inflammatory and pro-osteogenic effects significantly improved trabecular bone microstructure in osteoporotic mice.\nCopyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Anti-aging is a complex and worldwide conundrum for eliminating the various pathologies of senility. The past decade has seen great progress in the understanding of the aging-associated signaling pathways and their application for developing anti-aging approaches. Currently, some drugs can improve quality of life. The activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling is one of the core and detrimental mechanisms related to aging; rapamycin can reduce the rate of aging, improve age-related diseases by inhibiting the mTOR pathway, and prolong lifespan and healthspan effectively. However, the current evidence for rapamycin in lifespan extension and organ aging is fragmented and scattered. In this review, we summarize the efficacy and safety of rapamycin in prolonging a healthy lifespan by systematically alleviating aging in multiple organ systems, i.e., the nervous, urinary, digestive, circulatory, motor, respiratory, endocrine, reproductive, integumentary and immune systems, to provide a theoretical basis for the future clinical application of rapamycin in anti-aging.\nCopyright © 2021.

Proteomics and in silico approaches now offer the possibility to complement each other to further understand the regulatory involvement of these modifications in parasites and infection biology. Accordingly, the current review highlights key expressed or altered proteins and PTMs are invisible switches that turn on and off the function of most of the proteins. PTMs include phosphorylation, glycosylation, ubiquitylation, palmitoylation, myristoylation, prenylation, acetylation, methylation, and epigenetic PTMs in P. falciparum which have been recently identified. But also other low-abundant or overlooked PTMs that might be important for the parasite's survival, infectivity, antigenicity, immunomodulation and pathogenesis. We here emphasize the PTMs as regulatory pathways playing major roles in the biology, pathogenicity, metabolic pathways, survival, host-parasite interactions and the life cycle of P. falciparum. Further validations and functional characterizations of such proteins might confirm the discovery of therapeutic targets and might most likely provide valuable data for the treatment of P. falciparum, the main cause of severe malaria in human.\nCopyright © 2018.

Here, we complete the first proteomic assessment of mouse seminal vesicles and assess the impact of the reproductive toxicant acrylamide. Mice were administered acrylamide (25 mg/kg bw/day) or control daily for five consecutive days prior to collecting seminal vesicle tissue. A total of 5,013 proteins were identified in the seminal vesicle proteome with bioinformatic analyses identifying cell proliferation, protein synthesis, cellular death and survival pathways as prominent biological processes. Secreted proteins were amongst the most abundant and several proteins are linked with seminal vesicle phenotypes. Analysis of the effect of acrylamide on the seminal vesicle proteome revealed 311 differentially regulated (FC ± 1.5, p ≤ 0.05, 205 up-regulated, 106 down-regulated) proteins, orthogonally validated via immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. Pathways that initiate protein synthesis to promote cellular survival were prominent amongst the dysregulated pathways and Rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR (RICTOR, p = 6.69E-07) was a top-ranked upstream driver. Oxidative stress was implicated as contributing to protein changes, with acrylamide causing an increase in 8-OHdG in seminal vesicle epithelial cells (5-fold increase, p = 0.016) and the surrounding smooth muscle layer (2-fold increase, p = 0.043). Additionally, acrylamide treatment caused a reduction in seminal vesicle secretion weight (36% reduction, p = 0.009) and total protein content (25% reduction, p = 0.017). Together these findings support the interpretation that toxicant exposure influences male accessory gland physiology and highlights the need to consider the response of all male reproductive tract tissues when interpreting the impact of environmental stressors on male reproductive function.\nCopyright © 2021 The Authors.

CRC risk at the time of diagnosis was 14.7% (95% CI 11.4-18.8%), while risk during surveillance was 2.8% (95% CI 1.8-4.4%) or 7 cases per 1000 person-years. SPS patients also had a high incidence of history of CRC prior to SPS diagnosis (7.0%, 95% CI 4.6-11.7).\nOur meta-analysis demonstrated that patients with SPS have an elevated risk of CRC, which is highest at the time of diagnosis and suggests the importance of early SPS recognition and screening to modify CRC risk. The persistently elevated CRC risk during surveillance supports current guidelines recommending heightened surveillance protocols.\nCopyright © 2021 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

In this review, we focused on mitochondrial ROS (mitoROS) and discussed on the mechanisms mediating their formation. The metalloid promotes direct effects in mitochondria, resulting in superoxide formation only under conditions of increased mitochondrial Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]m). In this perspective, the time of exposure and concentration requirements for arsenite were largely conditioned by other effects of the metalloid in specific sites of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Arsenite induced a slow and limited mobilization of Ca2+ from IP3R via a saturable mechanism, failing to increase the [Ca2+]m. This effect was however associated with the triggering of an intraluminal crosstalk between the IP3R and the ryanodine receptor (RyR), causing a large and concentration dependent release of Ca2+ from RyR and a parallel increase in [Ca2+]m. Thus, the Ca2+-dependent mitoO2-. formation appears to be conditioned by the spatial/functional organization of the ER/mitochondria network and RyR expression. We also speculate on the possibility that the ER stress response might regulate the above effects on the intraluminal crosstalk between the IP3R and the RyR via oxidation of critical thiols mediated by the H2O2 locally released by oxidoreductin 1α.\nCopyright © 2021.

Despite their significant importance, there is no consensus on the origin of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). In this study, we demonstrated that small extracellular vesicle (sEV)-packaged TGFβ1 can reprogram normal fibroblasts (NFs) into CAFs both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, TGFβ1 in sEV activated NFs by regulating fibronectin, rather than modulating the canonical TGFβ-Smad signal pathway. Furthermore, TGFβ1 and fibronectin are related to HNSCC clinicopathologic features. Plasma sEV TGFβ1 may serve as a potential diagnostic biomarker for HNSCC. This hitherto unknown mechanism of reprogramming of NFs into CAFs by a unique pathway has major implications for underlying cancer-recruited stroma responses.\nCopyright © 2021.

Alleviating tumor hypoxia to improve the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) represented by programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibody has become a meaningful strategy. In this study, we adopted three methods to alleviate hypoxia, including direct oxygen delivery using two different carriers and an indirect way involving HIF-1α inhibition. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments showed that liposomes modified with perfluorocarbon or hemoglobin (PFC@lipo or Hb@lipo) were able to efficiently load and release oxygen, relieving tumor hypoxia. However, the gas release behavior of PFC@lipo was uncontrollable, which might induce acute hyperoxia side effects during intravenous injection and reduce its biosafety. In contrast, whether administered locally or systemically, Hb@lipo revealed high animal tolerance, and was much safer than commercial HIF-1α inhibitor (PX-478), displaying prospects as a promising oxygen carrier for clinical practice. Pharmacodynamic experiments suggested that Hb@lipo helped PD-1 antibody break the therapeutic bottleneck and significantly inhibited the progression of 4 T1 breast cancer. But in CT26 colon cancer, the combination therapy failed to suppress tumor growth. After in-depth analysis and comparison, we found that the ratio of M1/M2 tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) between these two tumor models were dramatically different. And the lower M1/M2 ratio in CT26 tumors limited the anti-tumor effect of combination therapy. In this study, three methods for alleviating tumor hypoxia were compared from the perspectives of biosafety, efficacy and clinical applicability. Among them, Hb@lipo stood out, and its combined use with PD-1 antibody exhibit a distinct synergistic suppression effect on tumors with more M1 macrophages presented in the microenvironment. Our work provided a good reference for improving the efficacy of PD-1 antibody by alleviating tumor hypoxia.\nCopyright © 2021.

Costs were estimated from a Dutch healthcare perspective. Threshold analyses were performed to identify the thresholds of complications and costs for MR-Linac to be cost-effective, while holding other outcomes such as biochemical progression and mortality constant. One-way sensitivity analyses were performed to outline uncertainty outcomes.\nAt €6,460 per patient, no reductions in complications were needed to consider MR-Linac cost-effective compared to EBRT 20 and 39 fractions. Compared to EBRT 5 fractions and LDR brachytherapy, MR-Linac was found to be cost-effective when complications are relatively reduced by 54% and 66% respectively. Results are highly sensitive to the utilities of urinary, bowel and sexual complications and the probability of biochemical progression.\nMR-Linac is found to be cost-effective compared to 20 and 39 fractions EBRT at baseline. For MR-Linac to become cost-effective over 5 fractions EBRT and LDR brachytherapy, it has to reduce complications substantially or be offered at lower costs.\nCopyright © 2021 The Author(s).

The irradiated samples were analyzed using liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry to detect degradation products or conformational alterations created by irradiation with high energy photons and associated secondary electrons.\nNo significant change in chemical composition or displacement of gadolinium ions from their chelates was discovered in samples irradiated with 7 MV photons at relevant clinical doses in a 1.5 T MR-Linac. Additionally, no significant correlation between concentrations of irradiated MRI contrast agents and radiation dose was observed.\nThe chemical composition stability of the irradiated contrast agents is promising for future use throughout the course of patient treatment.

However, clinical responses to romidepsin are typically transient, highlighting the need for more effective therapies. Here, we show synergistic anti-lymphoma effects of romidepsin in combination with mechlorethamine, an alkylating agent, in CTCL cell lines and primary samples with strong antitumor effects in an in vivo model of SS. Mechanistically, gene expression profiling points to abrogation of Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling as important mediator of this interaction. Consistently, the combination of mechlorethamine plus romidepsin resulted in downregulation of STAT5 phosphorylation in romidepsin-sensitive cell lines and primary SS samples, but not in romidepsin-resistant tumors. Moreover, and in further support of JAK/STAT signaling as a modulator of romidepsin activity in CTCL, treatment with romidepsin in combination with JAK inhibitors resulted in markedly increased therapeutic responses. Overall, these results support a role for romidepsin plus mechlorethamine in combination in the treatment of CTCL and uncover a previously unrecognized role for JAK-STAT signaling in the response to romidepsin and romidepsin-based combination therapies in SS.\nCopyright © 2021 The Authors.

The toxin's B subunit (RTB) is a Gal/GalNAc-specific lectin that attaches to cell surfaces and promotes retrograde transport of ricin's A subunit (RTA) to the trans Golgi network (TGN) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). RTA is liberated from RTB in the ER and translocated into the cell cytoplasm, where it functions as a ribosome-inactivating protein. While antibodies against ricin's individual subunits have been reported, we now describe seven alpaca-derived, single-domain antibodies (VHHs) that span the RTA-RTB interface, including four Tier 1 VHHs with IC50 values <1 nM. Crystal structures of each VHH bound to native ricin holotoxin revealed three different binding modes, based on contact with RTA's F-G loop (mode 1), RTB's subdomain 2γ (mode 2) or both (mode 3). VHHs in modes 2 and 3 were highly effective at blocking ricin attachment to HeLa cells and immobilized asialofetuin, due to framework residues (FR2) that occupied the 2γ Gal/GalNAc-binding pocket and mimic ligand. The four Tier 1 VHHs also interfered with intracellular functions of RTB, as they neutralized ricin in a post-attachment cytotoxicity assay (e.g., the toxin was bound to cell surfaces before antibody addition) and reduced the efficiency of toxin transport to the TGN. We conclude that the RTA-RTB interface is a target of potent toxin-neutralizing antibodies that likely interfere with both extracellular and intracellular events in ricin's cytotoxic pathway.\nCopyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Fibronectin (FN), a major ECM macromolecule expressed by different cell types and also present in plasma, consists of multiple functional modules that bind to ECM-associated, plasma, and cell-surface proteins such as integrin and FN itself, thus ensuring its cell-adhesive and modulatory role. Here we show that FN constitutes an immune checkpoint. Thus, FN was identified as a physiological ligand for a tumor/leukemia/lymphoma- as well as autoimmune-associated checkpoint, ILT3/LILRB4 (B4, CD85k). Human B4 and the murine ortholog, gp49B, bound FN with sub-micromolar affinities as assessed by bio-layer interferometry. The major B4-binding site in FN was located at the N-terminal 30-kDa module (FN30), which is apart from the major integrin-binding site present at middle of the molecule. Blockade of B4-FN binding such as with B4 antibodies or a recombinant FN30-Fc fusion protein paradoxically ameliorated autoimmune disease in lupus-prone BXSB/Yaa mice. These unexpected nature of the B4-FN checkpoint in autoimmunity is discussed, referring to its potential role in tumor immunity.\n© The Japanese Society for Immunology. 2021. All rights reserved.

The ROS (reactive oxygen species) levels of each treatment were evaluated by DCFH-DA oxidisation methods. The activity of glutathione reductase and the levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) and oxidised glutathione (GSSG) were assessed using assay kits. The expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins were analysed by western blotting.\nThe activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), a key enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway, significantly decreased in Gem + HY groups, however, the ROS level enhanced accompanying with GSH depleting, mitochondrial membrane depolarisation and cytochrome C release. Gem + HY inhibits the expression of Bcl-2 but stimulates Bax level, triggering caspase activation and PARP cleavage and thus promoted apoptosis of Capan-2 cells.\nWe demonstrated that Gem combined HY-PDT could inhibit the proliferation of Capan-2 cells and induce cell apoptosis.

However, this is achieved in only 60 per cent of patients. The aim of this study is to investigate whether the addition of induction chemotherapy to neoadjuvant chemo(re)irradiation improves the R0 resection rate in LRRC.\nThis multicentre, international, open-label, phase III, parallel-arms study will enrol 364 patients with resectable LRRC after previous partial or total mesorectal resection without synchronous distant metastases or recent chemo- and/or radiotherapy treatment. Patients will be randomized to receive either induction chemotherapy (three 3-week cycles of CAPOX (capecitabine, oxaliplatin), four 2-week cycles of FOLFOX (5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin) or FOLFORI (5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan)) followed by neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and surgery (experimental arm) or neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and surgery alone (control arm). Tumours will be restaged using MRI and, in the experimental arm, a further cycle of CAPOX or two cycles of FOLFOX/FOLFIRI will be administered before chemoradiotherapy in case of stable or responsive disease. The radiotherapy dose will be 25 × 2.0 Gy or 28 × 1.8 Gy in radiotherapy-naive patients, and 15 × 2.0 Gy in previously irradiated patients. The concomitant chemotherapy agent will be capecitabine administered twice daily at a dose of 825 mg/m2 on radiotherapy days. The primary endpoint of the study is the R0 resection rate. Secondary endpoints are long-term oncological outcomes, radiological and pathological response, toxicity, postoperative complications, costs, and quality of life.\nThis trial protocol describes the PelvEx II study.

Agreement across guidelines was low (kappa = 0.24), meaning that different patients had a similar risk of being treated inaccurately.\nAvailable guidelines are inaccurate in identifying patients with DCIS who would benefit from upfront SLNB. Guideline refinement with detailed preoperative work-up and novel techniques for SLND identification could address this challenge and avoid overtreatment.\n© The Author(s) 2021.

However, traditional PLSS uses either a rotatable polarizer or two orthogonal polarizers to purify the single scattering light, which makes it complicated and challenged to build a PLSS endoscope. Herein, we propose a snapshot PLSS with a single optical path to directly get the single scattering light for the first time. The single scattering light is encoded using the spectrally-modulated polarimetry and decoded using the continuous slide iterative method. Both the polystyrene microsphere solutions and the ex vivo gastric cancer samples are used to verify the method. The experimental results of the snapshot PLSS are consistent well with that of the traditional PLSS. The proposed method has a potential for the building of snapshot PLSS endoscope systems in future.

The adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of overall survival, disease-specific survival, and disease-free survival were extracted and pooled.\nEleven included studies were published between 2009 and 2019. The cumulative number of patients was 20,607 (range 35-14,554). Extranodal extension was adjusted or evaluated in all of the studies. The meta-analysis indicated that a higher lymph node burden was significantly related to worse overall survival (HR 2.62, 95% CI 2.12-3.25), worse disease-specific survival (HR 3.14, 95% CI 1.85-5.33) and worse disease-free survival (HR 2.30, 95% CI 1.62-3.26). The highest hazard ratio was observed when the cutoff value was 3 for overall survival, 3 for disease-specific survival, and 4 for disease-free survival. The hazard ratio showed an upward trend before the cutoff value of 3 but no significant incremental change when the cutoff exceeded 3.\nIn oral squamous cell carcinoma, lymph node burden is an independent prognosticator for survival outcomes.

The incidence and mortality of COVID-19 patients have been increasing at an alarming rate. The mortality is much higher in older individuals, especially the ones suffering from respiratory distress, cardiac abnormalities, renal diseases, diabetes, and hypertension. Existing evidence demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 makes its entry into human cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) followed by the uptake of virions through cathepsin L or transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). SARS-CoV-2-mediated abnormalities in particular cardiovascular and neurological ones and the damaged coagulation systems require extensive research to develop better therapeutic modalities. As SARS-CoV-2 uses its S-protein to enter into the host cells of several organs, the S-protein of the virus is considered as the ideal target to develop a potential vaccine. In this review, we have attempted to highlight the landmark discoveries that lead to the development of various vaccines that are currently under different stages of clinical progression. Besides, a brief account of various drug candidates that are being tested to mitigate the burden of COVID-19 was also covered.

The Italian surgical community has captured the need and undertaken the effort to establish a National Consensus on this topic. Four main areas of interest have been analysed: patients' selection, procedures, techniques, and implementations. To establish consensus, an adapted Delphi method was used through as many reiterative rounds were needed. Systematic literature reviews were conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses instructions. The Consensus took place between February 2019 and July 2020. Twenty-six Italian centres participated. Eighteen clinically relevant items were identified. After a total of three Delphi rounds, 30-tree recommendations reached expert consensus establishing the herein presented guidelines. The Italian Consensus on MI surgery for SCRLM indicates possible pathways to optimise the treatment for these patients as consensus papers express a trend that is likely to become shortly a standard procedure for clinical pictures still on debate.

Compared with non-weight cyclers (no attempt of intentional weight loss), severe cyclers (≥ 3 times of intentional weight loss of ≥ 4.5 kg) were at increased kidney cancer risk after adjusting for BMI before weight cycling (pooled multivariable-adjusted HR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.19, 2.66). Additional adjustment for attained BMI after weight cycling had minimal influence. There was a positive trend between weight cycling by frequency and magnitude and kidney cancer risk (P-trend = 0.01). Moreover, the observed positive association did not differ by subtypes of cyclers (e.g., adiposity status, weight-loss methods). In the meta-analysis, we found a strong positive association between weight cycling and kidney cancer risk (summary relative risk for weight cyclers vs. non-cyclers, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.16, 1.96; I2: 52.2%; 6 studies).\nFrequent substantial weight cycling was associated with increased risk of kidney cancer, independent of BMI.

We tested whether these exposures as well as their interaction were associated with autism-related phenotypes in 121 laboratory-housed chimpanzees. We used expert-derived weights to obtain autism scores from ratings on the 43-item Chimpanzee Personality Questionnaire; higher scores indicated more autistic-like traits. The first model included fixed effects for sex, age, and rearing, and a random effect that addressed the relatedness of subjects. The second model was the same except that it also included the rearing × AVPR1A genotype interaction as a fixed effect. Both models indicated that the phenotype was moderately heritable and that chimpanzees reared by their mothers had lower scores on the scale. The effect of genotype in both models indicated that chimpanzees with an indel deletion had higher scores on the scale, although the credible interval included zero. Moreover, the rearing × genotype interaction in the second model indicated that chimpanzees who possessed the non-deletion genotype and who were reared by their mother were at even greater risk. The credible interval for this effect did not include zero, but fit statistics indicated that the model without the interaction was marginally better, and the interaction was in the opposite direction than we expected based on previous work. These findings highlight the importance of rearing effects in the typical social development of our closet-living nonhuman relative. LAY SUMMARY: We tested whether, in chimpanzees, scores on a scale comprising traits that resembled aspects of autism were related to a gene associated with autism in prior research and/or early rearing. Human-reared chimpanzees had higher scores (indicating more autistic-like traits). Chimpanzees that possessed the gene also had higher scores, but we could not exclude the possibility that there was no effect of genotype. These findings suggest that we can measure autism-like characteristics in chimpanzees, and so study it in this species.\n© 2021 The Authors.

N-nitrosamines are pro-mutagens that can react with DNA following metabolism to produce DNA adducts, such as O6 -alkyl-guanine. The adducts can result in DNA replication miscoding errors leading to GC > AT mutations and increased risk of genomic instability and carcinogenesis. Both NDMA and NDEA are known rodent carcinogens in male and female rats. The DNA repair enzyme, methylguanine DNA-methyltransferase can restore DNA integrity via the removal of alkyl groups from guanine in an error-free fashion and this can result in nonlinear dose responses and a point of departure or \"practical threshold\" for mutation at low doses of exposure. Following International recommendations (ICHM7; ICHQ3C and ICHQ3D), we calculated permissible daily exposures (PDE) for NDMA and NDEA using published rodent cancer bioassay and in vivo mutagenicity data to determine benchmark dose values and define points of departure and adjusted with appropriate uncertainty factors (UFs). PDEs for NDMA were 6.2 and 0.6 μg/person/day for cancer and mutation, respectively, and for NDEA, 2.2 and 0.04 μg/person/day. Both PDEs are higher than the acceptable daily intake values (96 ng for NDMA and 26.5 ng for NDEA) calculated by regulatory authorities using simple linear extrapolation from carcinogenicity data. These PDE calculations using a bench-mark approach provide a more robust assessment of exposure limits compared with simple linear extrapolations and can better inform risk to patients exposed to the contaminated sartans.

Along with appearance of γH2AX foci, the variable fraction of the cells exhibits homogeneously stained γH2AX signal resulting in so called γH2AX pan-staining, which is believed to appear at early stages of apoptosis. Here, we investigated incidence of γH2AX pan-staining at different time points after irradiation with γ-rays using IFC and compared the obtained data with the data from FM. Appearance of γH2AX pan-staining during the apoptotic process was further analyzed by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) of cells at different stages of apoptosis and subsequent immunofluorescence analysis. Our results show that IFC was able to reveal dose dependence of pan-staining, while FM failed to detect all pan-staining cells. Moreover, we found that γH2AX pan-staining could be induced by therapeutic, but not low doses of γ-rays and correlate well with percentage of apoptotic cells as analyzed using flow cytometric Annexin-V/7-AAD assay. Further investigations showed that γH2AX pan-staining is formed in the early phases of apoptosis and remains until later stages of apoptotic process.

A TLC-densitometric method was developed and validated to estimate the levels of saponins, calculated as ardisiacrispin A, in different plant parts in both varieties. Their content amounted to 22.17±4.75 and 25.72±1.46 mg/g d.w. in roots, and 2.64±0.74 and 3.43±0.70 mg/g d.w. in fruits of red-berried and white-berried ardisia, respectively. Assessment of cytotoxicity of ardisiacrispin A and A. crenata extracts on a panel of human cancer cell lines revealed a similar effect of root extracts from both varieties, with the highest potency against melanoma WM793 and colon cancer Caco2.

Fifteen articles were included, consisting of seven randomised controlled trials, six cohort studies and two non-randomised trials with a total of 2,517 participants. The type and timing of EOF varied considerably across studies with limited reporting of energy and protein intake from oral or enteral feeding. Fourteen studies assessed post-operative complications of which thirteen reported no difference between EOF and standard care. Fourteen studies assessed post-operative LOS and of these, thirteen reported a reduced length of stay in the EOF group. Four of fifteen studies assessing nutritional status found no difference between groups. Three of fifteen studies assessed quality of life with inconsistent findings. This review found EOF reduced post-operative LOS and did not increase post-operative complications. However, the optimal timing for the introduction of EOF could not be established.

According the Z0011 results, 72 (43.1%) received no further ART; and based on AMAROS criteria 95 (56.9%) received ART. Median follow-up was 54 months. The 5-year overall survival was 96.8% in the non-RT cohort and 93.4% in the RT cohort (p = 0.19), while the respective 5-year disease-free survivals were 100% and 92.3% (p = 1.06). Lymphedema developed in 3.6% of patients after SLNB versus 43% after ALND (OR 20.25; 95%CI 8.13-50.43). Decreased upper-extremity range of motion appeared in 8.4% of patients after SLNB versus 31.2% after ALND (OR 4.95; 95%CI 2.45-9.98%).\nOur study confirms that omitting ALND is safe and has high survival rates in patients with T1-T2 tumours and ≤ 2 positive SLNs. Adding ART could be a treatment option for patients who present other risk factors.

The membrane-bound serine protease prostasin was previously identified as a HAI-2 target protease in intestinal tissues but not in the skin. In both tissues, the highly related inhibitor HAI-1 is, however, the default inhibitor for prostasin and the type 2 transmembrane serine protease matriptase. This cell-type selective functional linkage may contribute to the organ-selective damage associated with SPINT 2 mutations. To this end, the impact of HAI-2 deletion on matriptase and prostasin proteolysis were, here, compared using Caco-2 human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells and HaCaT human keratinocytes. Greatly enhanced prostasin proteolytic activity with a prolonged half-life and significant depletion of HAI-1 monomer were observed with HAI-2 loss in Caco-2 cells but not HaCaT cells. The constitutive, high level prostasin zymogen activation observed in Caco-2 cells, but not in HaCaT cells, also contributes to the excessive prostasin proteolytic activity caused by HAI-2 loss. HAI-2 deletion also caused increased matriptase zymogen activation, likely as an indirect result of increased prostasin proteolysis. This increase in activated matriptase, however, only had a negligible role in depletion of HAI-1 monomer. Our study suggests that the constitutive, high level of prostasin zymogen activation and the cell-type selective functional relationship between HAI-2 and prostasin renders Caco-2 cells more susceptible than HaCaT cells to the loss of HAI-2, causing a severe imbalance favoring prostasin proteolysis.\n© The Author(s) 2021.

All six cases were characterized by the presence of spindled to ovoid cells arranged in concentric whorls and cords against a myxoid to myxohyaline stroma and relatively cellular aggregates of plump ovoid to epithelioid cells. Four cases showed distinct hyalinized blood vessels. Both cases that involved the subcutis showed peripheral lipofibromatosis-like areas. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were absent to moderate. Severe cytologic atypia or conspicuous mitotic activity was not identified. Immunohistochemically, all tumors diffusely expressed ALK (D5F3) and CD34. All but one tumor was diffusely positive for S100 protein. All tumors were negative for EMA, AE1/AE3, SMA, and SOX10. Next-generation sequencing revealed ALK fusions with FLNA (3 cases), MYH10 (2 cases), and HMBOX1 (1 case) as the partner genes. In all six cases, the breakpoints involved exon 20 of ALK, which preserves the receptor tyrosine kinase domains of ALK in the fusion product. Of the four cases with limited follow-up information (2-18 months), none recurred. In conclusion, we report an ALK-rearranged cutaneous soft tissue tumor characterized by the presence of myxoid spindle cell whorls and cords, and co-expression of ALK, CD34, and frequently S100 protein, we term \"superficial ALK-rearranged myxoid spindle cell neoplasm\".\n", "authors": "Josephine K Dermawan,Elizabeth M Azzato,John R Goldblum,Brian P Rubin,Steven D Billings,Jennifer S Ko", "pmid": "34088997", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:25.582Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:25.582Z", "publish_date": "2021-06-04", "keywords": "", "slug": "superficial-alk-rearranged-myxoid-spindle-cell-neo", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 2291, "fields": {"title": "Sunitinib and Axitinib increase secretion and glycolytic activity of small extracellular vesicles in renal cell carcinoma.", "body": "\nExtracellular vesicles (EVs) encompass a wide range of vesicles that are released by all cell types.

These sEVs displayed increased glucose uptake and glycolytic metabolism compared to sEVs released from vehicle-treated cells.

Here we utilize a mathematical model to assess the impact of masking on transmission within individual transmission pairs and at the population level. Our model quantitatively links mask efficacy to reductions in viral load and subsequent transmission risk. Our results reinforce that the use of masks by both a potential transmitter and exposed person substantially reduces the probability of successful transmission, even if masks only lower exposure viral load by ~ 50%. Slight increases in mask adherence and/or efficacy above current levels would reduce the effective reproductive number (Re) substantially below 1, particularly if implemented comprehensively in potential super-spreader environments. Our model predicts that moderately efficacious masks will also lower exposure viral load tenfold among people who get infected despite masking, potentially limiting infection severity. Because peak viral load tends to occur pre-symptomatically, we also identify that antiviral therapy targeting symptomatic individuals is unlikely to impact transmission risk. Instead, antiviral therapy would only lower Re if dosed as post-exposure prophylaxis and if given to ~ 50% of newly infected people within 3 days of an exposure. These results highlight the primacy of masking relative to other biomedical interventions under consideration for limiting the extent of the COVID-19 pandemic prior to widespread implementation of a vaccine.

Low Caspase 8 expression levels in ovarian cancers correlate with resistance to apoptotic chemotherapy, and a subpopulation of patients with low Caspase 8 levels exhibit poorer overall survival after standard-of-care treatment.

Significantly, transcripts encoding extracellular matrix proteins are consistently upregulated with METTL3 knockdown. We also examined the relationship between METTL3 and androgen signaling and discovered the upregulation of a hepatocyte nuclear factor-driven gene signature that is associated with therapy resistance in prostate cancer.

Oncogenic RAS mutations, causing constitutive activation of multiple tumor-promoting pathways, are frequently found in human cancer. So far in hematologic malignancies, RAS mutations have only been reported to occur in hematopoietic cells. In this study, we investigated the effect of oncogenic Kras expression in the BMME in a chimeric mouse model. We observed that an activating mutation of Kras in the non-hematopoietic system leads to a phenotype resembling myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) characterized by peripheral cytopenia, marked dysplasia within the myeloid lineage as well as impaired proliferation and differentiation capacity of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). The phenotypical changes could be reverted when the BM was re-isolated and transferred into healthy recipients, indicating that the KrasG12D-activation in the non-hematopoietic BMME was essential for the MDS phenotype. Gene expression analysis of sorted non-hematopoietic bone marrow (BM) niche cells from KrasG12D mice revealed upregulation of multiple inflammation-related genes including IL-1-superfamily members (Il1α, Il1β, Il1f9) and the NLPR3 inflammasome. Thus, pro-inflammatory IL-1-signaling in the BMME may contribute to MDS development. Our findings show that a single genetic change in the non-hematopoietic BMME can cause an MDS phenotype.

Neuroblastoma (NB) is a heterogenous pediatric cancer with a five-year survival rate of less than 50% for high-risk patients, which include nearly all cases with amplified MYCN. We previously demonstrated that venetoclax is active in MYCN-amplified NB but has limited single-agent activity in most models, presumably the result of other pro-survival BCL-2 family protein expression or insufficient pro-death protein mobilization. As the relative tolerability of venetoclax makes it amenable to co-dosing with other therapies, we evaluated the sensitivity of MYCN-amplified NB models to rational combinations of venetoclax with agents that have both mechanistic complementarity and active clinical programs. First, MDM2 inhibitor NVP-CGM097 increases the pro-death BH3-only protein NOXA to sensitize p53-wild-type, MYCN-amplified NBs to venetoclax. Second, the MCL-1 inhibitor S63845 sensitizes MYCN-amplified NB through neutralization of MCL-1, inducing synergistic cell killing when combined with venetoclax. Lastly, the standard of care drug cocktail cyclophosphamide and topotecan reduces the apoptotic threshold of NB, thus setting the stage for robust combination efficacy with venetoclax. In all cases, these rational combinations translated to in vivo tumor regressions in MYCN-amplified PDX models.

Effective therapeutic strategies are limited even though patients receive a combination of chemotherapeutics. These tumors harbor thousands of mutations that contribute to tumor development. Downstream of oncogenic driving mutations, altered tumor mitochondria promote resistance to apoptosis. Dynamic Bcl-2 homology-3 profiling (DBP) is a functional assay of live cells that identifies the mitochondrial proteins responsible for resistance to apoptosis. We hypothesized that DBP will predict which protein to target to overcome resistance thereby enhancing combinatorial therapy. DBP predicted that targeting either Mcl-1 or Bcl-xL increases the efficacy of the chemotherapeutic agent, cisplatin, whereas targeting Bcl-2 does not. We performed these assays by treating EAC and MPM cells with a combination of BH3 mimetics and cisplatin. Following treatments, we performed efficacy assessments including apoptosis assays, IC50 calculations, and generation of a combinatorial index. DBP confirmed that targeting mitochondria with BH3 mimetics alters the threshold of apoptosis. These apoptotic effects were abolished when the mitochondrial pathway was disrupted. We validated our findings by developing knockdown models of anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, and the mitochondrial effector proteins Bax/Bak. Knockdown of Mcl-1 or Bcl-xL recapitulated the results of BH3 mimetics. Additionally, we report an approach for BH3 profiling directly from patient tumor samples.

Biomarkers for outcome are missing and the association of baseline immune function and clinical outcome remains to be determined. We assessed the in vitro nonspecific stimulation of immune response at baseline and during anti-PD-1 therapy for metastatic melanoma.\nPreviously untreated metastatic melanoma patients received nivolumab and radiotherapy as part of the multicentric phase II trial NIRVANA (NCT02799901). The levels of Th1, Th2 and Th17 cytokines on in vitro non-specific stimulation of innate and adaptive immune cells were measured in patient sera before treatment, and at week 2 and week 6 after the beginning of the treatment, and correlated with tumorous response, progression-free survival (PFS) and occurrence of immune-related adverse events (irAEs). The results in melanoma patients were compared with those of a cohort of 9 sex and age-matched healthy donors.\nSeventeen patients were enrolled in this ancillary study. Median follow-up was 16 months (2.2-28.4). The 12-month PFS rate was 67.7%. The incidence of irAEs of any grade was 58.8%. Without in vitro stimulation no differences in cytokines levels were observed between responders and non-responders. On in vitro stimulation, metastatic patients had lower Th1 cytokine levels than healthy donors at baseline for tumor necrosis factor-α and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) (1136 pg/mL vs 5558 pg/mL, p<0.0001; and 3894 pg/mL vs 17 129 pg/mL, p=0.02, respectively). Responders exhibited increasing cytokine levels from baseline to week 6. Non-responders had lower interleukin 17A (IL-17A) levels at baseline than responders (7 pg/mL vs 32 pg/mL, p=0.03), and lower IFN-γ levels at week 6 (3.3 ng/mL vs 14.5 ng/mL, p=0.03). A lower level of IL-17A at week 2 and a lower level of IFN-γ at week 6 correlated with worse PFS (p=0.04 and p=0.04 respectively). At baseline, patients who developed irAEs had higher IL-6 levels (19.3 ng/mL vs 9.2 ng/mL, p=0.03) and higher IL-17A levels (52.5 pg/mL vs 2.5 pg/mL, p=0.009) than those without irAEs.\nOur findings indicate that cytokine levels after in vitro non-specific stimulation could be a promising biomarker to predict the outcome of PD-1 inhibition therapy.\n© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

Therefore, the development of novel and effective therapies for mCRPC represents an urgent medical need. T cell engagers (TCEs) have emerged as a promising approach for the treatment of mCRPC due to their targeted mechanism of action. However, challenges remain in the clinic due to the limited efficacy of TCEs observed thus far in solid tumors as well as the toxicities associated with cytokine release syndrome (CRS) due to the usage of high-affinity anti-CD3 moieties such as OKT3.\nUsing genetically engineered transgenic rats (UniRat and OmniFlic) that express fully human IgG antibodies together with an NGS-based antibody discovery pipeline, we developed TNB-585, an anti-CD3xPSMA TCE for the treatment of mCRPC. TNB-585 pairs a tumor-targeting anti-PSMA arm together with a unique, low-affinity anti-CD3 arm in bispecific format. We tested TNB-585 in T cell-redirected cytotoxicity assays against PSMA+ tumor cells in both two-dimensional (2D) cultures and three-dimensional (3D) spheroids as well as against patient-derived prostate tumor cells. Cytokines were measured in culture supernatants to assess the ability of TNB-585 to induce tumor killing with low cytokine release. TNB-585-mediated T cell activation, proliferation, and cytotoxic granule formation were measured to investigate the mechanism of action. Additionally, TNB-585 efficacy was evaluated in vivo against C4-2 tumor-bearing NCG mice.\nIn vitro, TNB-585 induced activation and proliferation of human T cells resulting in the killing of PSMA+ prostate tumor cells in both 2D cultures and 3D spheroids with minimal cytokine release and reduced regulatory T cell activation compared with a positive control antibody that contains the same anti-PSMA arm but a higher affinity anti-CD3 arm (comparable with OKT3). In addition, TNB-585 demonstrated potent efficacy against patient-derived prostate tumors ex vivo and induced immune cell infiltration and dose-dependent tumor regression in vivo.\nOur data suggest that TNB-585, with its low-affinity anti-CD3, may be efficacious while inducing a lower incidence and severity of CRS in patients with prostate cancer compared with TCEs that incorporate high-affinity anti-CD3 domains.\n© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

Within MM bone marrow (BM) stromal cell supernatants, TNF-α induces proteasomal degradation of TRAF2, noncanonical NF-κB, and downstream ERK signaling in MM cells, whereas interleukin-6 directly triggers ERK activation. RNA sequencing of MM patient samples shows nearly universal ERK pathway activation at relapse on lenalidomide maintenance therapy, confirming its clinical relevance. Combination MEK inhibitor treatment restores IMiD sensitivity of TRAF2 KO cells both in vitro and in vivo. Our studies provide the framework for clinical trials of MEK inhibitors to overcome IMiD resistance in the BM microenvironment and improve patient outcome in MM.\nCopyright © 2021 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Here, we report a genetically engineered mouse model of HCC driven by loss of macroautophagy and hemizygosity of phosphatase and tensin homolog, which develops HCC involving ductular reaction. We show through lineage tracing that, following loss of autophagy, mature hepatocytes dedifferentiate into biliary-like liver progenitor cells (ductular reaction), giving rise to HCC. Furthermore, this change is associated with deregulation of yes-associated protein and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif transcription factors, and the combined, but not individual, deletion of these factors completely reverses the dedifferentiation capacity and tumorigenesis.

Though we are still far from achieving a complete picture of these relationships, our current understanding of simpler questions, such as the structure induced in the space of genotypes by sequences mapped to molecular structures, has revealed important facts that deeply affect the dynamical description of evolutionary processes. Empirical evidence supporting the fundamental relevance of features such as phenotypic bias is mounting as well, while the synthesis of conceptual and experimental progress leads to questioning current assumptions on the nature of evolutionary dynamics-cancer progression models or synthetic biology approaches being notable examples. This work delves with a critical and constructive attitude into our current knowledge of how genotypes map onto molecular phenotypes and organismal functions, and discusses theoretical and empirical avenues to broaden and improve this comprehension. As a final goal, this community should aim at deriving an updated picture of evolutionary processes soundly relying on the structural properties of genotype spaces, as revealed by modern techniques of molecular and functional analysis.\nCopyright © 2021 The Authors.

The present study investigates the antiproliferative and antitumor activity of Annona cherimola aqueous leaf (AAL) extract/infusion in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines in vitro. High-resolution LC-MS was first used to analyze the composition of the aqueous extract. Cell proliferation assay, Annexin V staining, cell cycle analysis, dual Annexin V/PI staining, cell death quantification by ELISA, ROS level detection and Western Blotting were then performed to elucidate the therapeutic effects of AAL extract. The results obtained revealed a potent antioxidant activity of AAL extract. Moreover, the extract exhibited dose- and time-dependent antiproliferative effects on AML cell lines by decreasing cell viability with an IC50 of 5.03% (v/v) at 24 h of treatment of KG-1 cells. This decrease in viability was accompanied with a significant increase in apoptotic cell death with cell cycle arrest and flipping of the phosphatidylserine from the inner to the outer leaflet of the cell membrane. The respective overexpression and downregulation of proapoptotic proteins like cleaved caspase-8, cleaved PARP-1 and Bax and antiapoptotic proteins like Bcl-2 further validated the apoptotic pathway induced by AAL on AML cells. Finally, LC-MS revealed the presence of several compounds like fatty acids, terpenes, phenolics, cinnamic acids and flavonoids that could contribute to the antioxidant and anti-cancer effects of this herbal infusion. In addition to the generally known nutritional effects of the Annona cherimola fruit and leaves, the presented data validates the antioxidant and anti-cancerous effects of the leaf infusion on AML cell lines, proposing its potential therapeutic use against acute myeloid leukemia with future in vivo and clinical trials.\nCopyright © 2021 The Authors.

Given the inherent differences between Veterans and the general United States population, we sought to investigate awareness of and attitudes toward clinical trials among Veterans diagnosed with cancer at a large, urban Veterans Administration Medical Center in Bronx, New York. The survey was administered in 2018-2019. Questions assessed sociodemographic characteristics, health literacy, and general attitudes about clinical trials. Based on key informant interviews, we also inquired about military-specific attitudes. Univariable analyses were conducted to evaluate differences in attitudes by age (<65 v ≥65 years) and race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic black v other). Of 115 Veterans approached, 67 (58.3%) completed the survey. Approximately 95% of participants were male, 59.7% were ≥65 years old, and 41.8% were non-Hispanic black. Only 58.2% reported knowing what a clinical trial is but 78.5% of Veterans stated that they trust doctors who do medical research and 87.5% reported they would strongly consider joining a trial if their VA primary care physician recommended it. Many stated that they would be part of a clinical trial if it would help fellow Veterans in the future (93.8%) and would help scientists learn how to treat other Veterans with the same disease (93.8%). Among non-Hispanic black participants, 62.5% agreed that the government has a history of using Veterans in experiments without their knowledge compared to 34.2% of Veterans of other race/ethnicity (P = 0.03). Clearly Veterans in our study were amenable to joining clinical trials. While many are aware of past misconduct in the treatment of military personnel in research, overall attitudes toward clinical trials were favorable and were especially positive when the possibility of improving cancer care for fellow Veterans was considered. In approaching Veterans regarding participation in a clinical trial we recommend education aligned with the literacy level of the Veteran, involvement of the VA primary care provider in clinical trial decisions, and awareness of a Veteran's altruism to help others.\nCopyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Although deep myometrial invasion (DMI) has been considered as a crucial risk factor in EC, it is unclear if its prognostic value is independent from The Cancer Genome ATLAS (TCGA) groups.\nTo assess if the prognostic value of DMI is independent from the TCGA groups in EC patients.\nA systematic review and meta-analysis was performed by searching through 5 electronic databases, from their inception to March 2021, for all studies that allowed to assess DMI as a prognostic factor independent of the TCGA groups in EC patients. Pooled hazard ratio (HR) of DMI for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) was calculated at multivariable analyses including TCGA groups as a variable. Superficial myometrial invasion (<50% of myometrial thickness) was considered as a reference. In DFS analyses, locoregional and distant recurrence were separately considered for one study.\nFive studies with 2469 patients were included in the systematic review and 3 studies with 1549 patients in the meta-analysis. Pooled HR of DMI was 1.082 (CI 95% 0.85-1.377; p = 0.524) for OS, 1.709 (CI 95% 1.173-2.491; p = 0.005) for DFS, 1.585 (CI 95% 1.154-2.178; p = 0.004) for DFS additionally considering locoregional recurrence for one study, and 1.701 (CI 95% 1.235-2.344, p = 0.001) for DFS additionally considering distant recurrence for the same study.\nDMI does not appear as an independent prognostic factor for OS in EC patients; instead, it seems to affect the risk of recurrence independently from the TCGA groups. Further studies are necessary to confirm these findings and to assess the prognostic impact of DMI separately in each TCGA group.\nCopyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Although FDG-PET is not indicated for the initial diagnosis of breast cancer, focally increased glucose metabolism within breast tissue represents a high likelihood for a neoplastic process and requires further evaluation. Focally increased glucose metabolism is not unique to breast cancer. Other malignancies such as lymphoma, metastases from solid tumors as well as inflammatory changes also may demonstrate increased glucose metabolism either within the breast or at other sites throughout the body. Importantly, benign breast disease may also exhibit increased glucose metabolism, limiting the specificity of FDG-PET. Breast cancer has a wide range of metabolic activity attributed to tumor heterogeneity and breast cancer subtype. Intracellular signaling pathways regulating tumor glucose utilization contribute to these pitfalls of PET/CT in breast cancer. The evaluation of axillary lymph nodes by FDG-PET is less accurate than sentinel lymph node procedure, however is very accurate in identifying level II and III axillary lymph node metastases or retropectoral metastases. It is important to note that non-malignant inflammation in lymph nodes are often detected by modern PET/CT technology. Therefore, particular consideration should be given to recent vaccinations, particularly to COVID-19, which can commonly result in increased metabolic activity of axillary nodes.

Additional procedures with regard to the bothersome voiding symptoms will be described.\nIn a small cohort of 5 patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer with tumor involvement of the bladder neck or proximal urethra (2 males/3 females) we performed the following reconstruction. A low pressure reservoir was achieved by antimesenteric longitudinal transection of terminal ileum and cecum/colon ascendens and formation of a pouch. To develop the neourethra, the appendix together with it is accompanying mesentery was drawn through the pelvic floor and sutured to the bulbar urethra in males or formed as a complete neourethra in female patients respectively.\nThere were no intraoperative nor early postoperative unwanted sequelae. Both male patients experienced recurrent anastomotic urethral stricture, consequently a Memokath stent and artificial urinary sphincter was implanted resulting in normal voluntary micturition. All female patients remained socially continent during the follow up period, one of them performing (clean intermittent catheterization) CIC.\nThe technique described offers the possibility of orthotopic bladder replacement even in traditionally unsuitable, but highly motivated patients, who are requesting orthotopic bladder replacement for improved body image. It allows extension of urethral resection and provides additional continence support. However, additional measures such as urethral stenting, CIC or artificial urinary sphincter implantation may be necessary for long lasting success. Although, not being a routine method for urinary diversion this technique may be used in select patients.\nCopyright © 2021 AEU. Published by Elsevier España, S.L.U.

And the signal amplification plays an important role in the development of sensitive ctDNA biosensors. Herein, the nanocomposites (denoted as HAC-AuPt), integrating from high-active carbon (HAC) and AuPt alloy nanoparticles, were synthesized and subsequently used as a signal amplification label to fabricate a sandwich-type ctDNA electrochemical biosensor. Characterizations demonstrated that HAC presents uniform size distribution and AuPt alloy nanoparticles were successfully loaded on HAC. The current response could be amplified to a great extent by the resultant HAC-AuPt due to its excellent electrochemical property. The nanocomposites were further bounded with DNA signal probes (SPs) via Au-S or Pt-S assembly to form SPs-label. After the capture probes (CPs) were immobilized on the electrode surface, the target DNA (tDNA) and SPs-label were stepwise incubated on the CPs-modified electrode, thus forming a sandwich-type structure. By monitoring the catalytic signal of HAC-AuPt towards the reduction process of H2O2, this biosensor provided a wide linear range of 10-8 mol/L - 10-16 mol/L with a low detection limit of 3.6 × 10-17 mol/L (S/N = 3) for the detection of the tDNA. Furthermore, obvious differences in response signals among different DNAs were observed benefitting from the excellent selectivity of the biosensor. Besides, the long-term stability, reproducibility, and recovery rate were proved to be outstanding. These results indicate that the established biosensor holds a potential application in the clinical diagnosis of ctDNA.\nCopyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Over-expressed tyrosinase has been confirmed by dozens of clinical studies as an independent factor to evaluate the malignancy of melanoma. Using Enteromorpha Prolifera as the raw material, herein we develop a novel fluorescent probe, ECDY, which can sensitively detect the tyrosinase activity in different types of cells. More importantly, melanoma cells can be specifically distinguished through cell lysate measurements as well as the whole-cell imaging technique. Mechanically, the tyrosine groups on the surface of ECDY can be specifically recognized by tyrosinase and further converted into dopaquinone, which consequently causes the intramolecular fluorescence quenching of the probe through photoinduced electron transfer (PET). Tyrosinase can be detected within 20 min in the solution, and the detection limit is as low as 0.067 U mL-1. For the in vitro demonstration, we evaluate the fluorescence decay of ECDY in response to the intracellular tyrosinase activity within the lysate of various cell lines, including non-cancerous, non-melanoma cancerous, and mouse melanoma ones. The experimental results verify that ECDY can accurately measure the apparent tyrosinase activity in different cell lines and detect melanoma cell lysate specifically. The confocal fluorescence imaging experiments further demonstrate that ECDY can distinguish melanoma cells from others significantly. We believe that ECDY provides a new strategy for the efficient detection of tyrosinase and melanoma cells, and is expected to apply as a clinical diagnosis platform.\nCopyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Although many cases of sugammadex-induced anaphylaxis have been reported, few studies have investigated the underlying mechanism.\nA 55-year-old Japanese man underwent a laryngectomy under general anesthesia. One month before laryngectomy, he had undergone laryngoscopy under general anesthesia and received sugammadex administration without causing hypersensitivity. He had no history of allergies. The operation was finished without complications. Shortly after sugammadex administration, his blood pressure dropped to approximately 70 mmHg, and his heart rate increased to 110 beats/minute with systemic erythema. Suspecting anaphylaxis, he was treated with the intravenous injection of phenylephrine, D-chlorpheniramine, and hydrocortisone. After these treatments, his cardiovascular condition stabilized. Eight months after the event, skin prick tests and intradermal tests with all agents used during general anesthesia were performed. Intradermal tests showed positive results only for sugammadex. Subsequently, basophil activation tests with CD203c were performed using sugammadex, γ-cyclodextrin, and positive controls (anti-immunoglobulin-E and formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine). In addition to both controls, sugammadex, but not γ-cyclodextrin, induced significant upregulation of CD203c expression. We performed additional basophil activation tests with wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, to investigate the mechanism underlying sugammadex-induced basophil activation. The inhibitory effect of wortmannin on basophil activation due to sugammadex was similar to that of anti-immunoglobulin-E, suggesting an immunoglobulin-E-dependent mechanism. Although the patient showed no hypersensitivity after the first exposure of sugammadex, anaphylaxis appeared after the second administration. Because most cases of sugammadex-induced anaphylaxis reportedly appeared after first administration, this seems to be a rare case.\nIn the present case, sugammadex-induced anaphylaxis might have occurred through an immunoglobulin-E-dependent mechanism and not involve γ-cyclodextrin as an epitope.

While clinical latency has been postulated to reflect the ability of residual tumor cells to persist in a dormant state, this hypothesis remains unproven since little is known about the biology of these cells. Consequently, defining the properties of residual tumor cells is an essential goal with important clinical implications for preventing recurrence and improving cancer outcomes.\nTo identify conserved features of residual tumor cells, we modeled minimal residual disease using inducible transgenic mouse models for HER2/neu and Wnt1-driven tumorigenesis that recapitulate cardinal features of human breast cancer progression, as well as human breast cancer cell xenografts subjected to targeted therapy. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting was used to isolate tumor cells from primary tumors, residual lesions following oncogene blockade, and recurrent tumors to analyze gene expression signatures and evaluate tumor-initiating cell properties.\nWe demonstrate that residual tumor cells surviving oncogenic pathway inhibition at both local and distant sites exist in a state of cellular dormancy, despite adequate vascularization and the absence of adaptive immunity, and retain the ability to re-enter the cell cycle and give rise to recurrent tumors after extended latency periods. Compared to primary or recurrent tumor cells, dormant residual tumor cells possess unique features that are conserved across mouse models for human breast cancer driven by different oncogenes, and express a gene signature that is strongly associated with recurrence-free survival in breast cancer patients and similar to that of tumor cells in which dormancy is induced by the microenvironment. Although residual tumor cells in both the HER2/neu and Wnt1 models are enriched for phenotypic features associated with tumor-initiating cells, limiting dilution experiments revealed that residual tumor cells are not enriched for cells capable of giving rise to primary tumors, but are enriched for cells capable of giving rise to recurrent tumors, suggesting that tumor-initiating populations underlying primary tumorigenesis may be distinct from those that give rise to recurrence following therapy.\nResidual cancer cells surviving targeted therapy reside in a well-vascularized, desmoplastic microenvironment at both local and distant sites. These cells exist in a state of cellular dormancy that bears little resemblance to primary or recurrent tumor cells, but shares similarities with cells in which dormancy is induced by microenvironmental cues. Our observations suggest that dormancy may be a conserved response to targeted therapy independent of the oncogenic pathway inhibited or properties of the primary tumor, that the mechanisms underlying dormancy at local and distant sites may be related, and that the dormant state represents a potential therapeutic target for preventing cancer recurrence.\n", "authors": "Jason R Ruth,Dhruv K Pant,Tien-Chi Pan,Hans E Seidel,Sanjeethan C Baksh,Blaine A Keister,Rita Singh,Christopher J Sterner,Suzanne J Bakewell,Susan E Moody,George K Belka,Lewis A Chodosh", "pmid": "34088357", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:32.944Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:32.944Z", "publish_date": "2021-06-04", "keywords": "Breast cancer", "slug": "cellular-dormancy-in-minimal-residual-disease-foll", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 2373, "fields": {"title": "Non-pharmacological sleep interventions for pediatric cancer patients and survivors: a systematic review protocol.", "body": "\nSleep disturbances constitute a common complication in pediatric cancer patients and survivors and are frequently severe enough to warrant treatment.

We also found that in addition to the formation of invadopodia in HCC progression, abnormal LINC00511 induces invadopodia formation in HCC cells by regulating the colocalization of vesicle associated membrane protein 7 (VAMP7) and synaptosome associated protein 23 (SNAP23) to induce the invadopodia formation, which are key secretion sites for MVBs and control exosome secretion. Finally, we revealed that LINC0051-induced invadopodia and exosome secretion were involved in tumor progression.\nOur experiments revealed novel findings on the relationship between LINC00511 dysregulation in HCC and invadopodia production and exosome secretion. This is a novel mechanism by which LINC00511 regulates invadopodia biogenesis and exosome secretion to further promote cancer progression.\n", "authors": "Xueqiang Peng,Xinyu Li,Shuo Yang,Mingyao Huang,Shibo Wei,Yingbo Ma,Yan Li,Bo Wu,Hongyuan Jin,Bowen Li,Shilei Tang,Qing Fan,Jingang Liu,Liang Yang,Hangyu Li", "pmid": "34088337", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:32.952Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:32.952Z", "publish_date": "2021-06-04", "keywords": "Exosome", "slug": "linc00511-drives-invasive-behavior-in-hepatocellul", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 2376, "fields": {"title": "Germline nuclear-predominant Pten murine model exhibits impaired social and perseverative behavior, microglial activation, and increased oxytocinergic activity.", "body": "\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) has a strong genetic etiology. Germline mutation in the tumor suppressor gene PTEN is one of the best described monogenic risk cases for ASD. Animal modeling of cell-specific Pten loss or mutation has provided insight into how disruptions to the function of PTEN affect neurodevelopment, neurobiology, and social behavior. As such, there is a growing need to understand more about how various aspects of PTEN activity and cell-compartment-specific functions, contribute to certain neurological or behavior phenotypes.\nTo understand more about the relationship between Pten localization and downstream effects on neurophenotypes, we generated the nuclear-predominant PtenY68H/+ mouse, which is identical to the genotype of some PTEN-ASD individuals. We subjected the PtenY68H/+ mouse to morphological and behavioral phenotyping, including the three-chamber sociability, open field, rotarod, and marble burying tests. We subsequently performed in vivo and in vitro cellular phenotyping and concluded the work with a transcriptomic survey of the PtenY68H/+ cortex, which profiled gene expression.\nWe observe a significant increase in P-Akt downstream of canonical Pten signaling, macrocephaly, decreased sociability, decreased preference for novel social stimuli, increased repetitive behavior, and increased thigmotaxis in PtenY68H/+ six-week-old (P40) mice. In addition, we found significant microglial activation with increased expression of complement and neuroinflammatory proteins in vivo and in vitro accompanied by enhanced phagocytosis. These observations were subsequently validated with RNA-seq and qRT-PCR, which revealed overexpression of many genes involved in neuroinflammation and neuronal function, including oxytocin. Oxytocin transcript was fivefold overexpressed (P = 0.0018), and oxytocin protein was strongly overexpressed in the PtenY68H/+ hypothalamus.\nThe nuclear-predominant PtenY68H/+ model has clarified that Pten dysfunction links to microglial pathology and this associates with increased Akt signaling. We also demonstrate that Pten dysfunction associates with changes in the oxytocin system, an important connection between a prominent ASD risk gene and a potent neuroendocrine regulator of social behavior. These cellular and molecular pathologies may related to the observed changes in social behavior. Ultimately, the findings from this work may reveal important biomarkers and/or novel therapeutic modalities that could be explored in individuals with germline mutations in PTEN with ASD.\n", "authors": "Nick Sarn,Stetson Thacker,Hyunpil Lee,Charis Eng", "pmid": "34088332", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:32.954Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:32.954Z", "publish_date": "2021-06-04", "keywords": "Autism spectrum disorder", "slug": "germline-nuclear-predominant-pten-murine-model-exh", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 2377, "fields": {"title": "Correction to: HDACi mediate UNG2 depletion, dysregulated genomic uracil and altered expression of oncoproteins and tumor suppressors in B- and T-cell lines.", "body": "", "authors": "Tobias S Iveland,Lars Hagen,Animesh Sharma,Mirta M L Sousa,Antonio Sarno,Kristian Lied Wollen,Nina Beate Liabakk,Geir Slupphaug", "pmid": "34088330", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:32.957Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:32.957Z", "publish_date": "2021-06-04", "keywords": "", "slug": "correction-to-hdaci-mediate-ung2-depletion-dysregu", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 2378, "fields": {"title": "The phosphatase Shp1 interacts with and dephosphorylates cortactin to inhibit invadopodia function.", "body": "\nInvadopodia are actin-based cell-membrane protrusions associated with the extracellular matrix degradation accompanying cancer invasion. The elucidation of the molecular mechanisms leading to invadopodia formation and activity is central for the prevention of tumor spreading and growth. Protein tyrosine kinases such as Src are known to regulate invadopodia assembly, little is however known on the role of protein tyrosine phosphatases in this process. Among these enzymes, we have selected the tyrosine phosphatase Shp1 to investigate its potential role in invadopodia assembly, due to its involvement in cancer development.\nCo-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence studies were employed to identify novel substrate/s of Shp1AQ controlling invadopodia activity. The phosphorylation level of cortactin, the Shp1 substrate identified in this study, was assessed by immunoprecipitation, in vitro phosphatase and western blot assays. Short interference RNA and a catalytically-dead mutant of Shp1 expressed in A375MM melanoma cells were used to evaluate the role of the specific Shp1-mediated dephosphorylation of cortactin. The anti-invasive proprieties of glycerophosphoinositol, that directly binds and regulates Shp1, were investigated by extracellular matrix degradation assays and in vivo mouse model of metastasis.\nThe data show that Shp1 was recruited to invadopodia and promoted the dephosphorylation of cortactin at tyrosine 421, leading to an attenuated capacity of melanoma cancer cells to degrade the extracellular matrix. Controls included the use of short interference RNA and catalytically-dead mutant that prevented the dephosphorylation of cortactin and hence the decrease the extracellular matrix degradation by melanoma cells. In addition, the phosphoinositide metabolite glycerophosphoinositol facilitated the localization of Shp1 at invadopodia hence promoting cortactin dephosphorylation. This impaired invadopodia function and tumor dissemination both in vitro and in an in vivo model of melanomas.\nThe main finding here reported is that cortactin is a specific substrate of the tyrosine phosphatase Shp1 and that its phosphorylation/dephosphorylation affects invadopodia formation and, as a consequence, the ability of melanoma cells to invade the extracellular matrix. Shp1 can thus be considered as a regulator of melanoma cell invasiveness and a potential target for antimetastatic drugs.

The present study aimed to explore the underlying mechanisms of matrine in suppressing the cell growth of DLBCL.\nThe influence of matrine on the viability of cultured DLBCL cell lines SU-DHL-16 and OCI-LY3 cells were determined by CCK-8. Apoptosis and cell cycle were measured by flow cytometry after matrine exposure. Western blot was taken to investigate the expression of activated Caspase-3, cleaved PARP, c-Myc, phospho-c-Myc (Ser62), CaMKIIγ, phospho-CaMKIIγ (Thr287), CDK4 and CDK6 after matrine treatment. Cycloheximide chase analysis was used to determine the c-Myc protein half-lives before and after matrine treatment. Growth salvage analysis was taken by ectopic expression of c-Myc.\nIn cultured DLBCL cells, matrine suppressed cell viability in a concentration and time dependent fashion. Matrine treated SU-DHL-16 and OCI-LY3 cells for 48 h with IC50 value of 1.76 mM and 4.1 mM, respectively. Matrine induced apoptosis through a caspase-independent pathway and caused G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in a concentration dependent manner in DLBCL cells. The protein expression of c-Myc was inhibited while the transcription of c-Myc was not reduced by matrine. c-Myc protein half-lives were decreased from 30.4, 69.4 min to 16.6, 15.9 min after matrine treatment in SU-DHL-16 and OCI-LY3, respectively.

Functional enrichment analyses are then typically used to detect annotations, such as biological processes that are significantly enriched among such differentially expressed proteins to provide insights into the molecular impacts of the studied conditions. While common, this analytical pipeline often heavily relies on arbitrary thresholds of significance. However, a functional annotation may be dysregulated in a given experimental condition, while none, or very few of its proteins may be individually considered to be significantly differentially expressed. Such an annotation would therefore be missed by standard approaches.\nHerein, we propose a novel graph theory-based method, PIGNON, for the detection of differentially expressed functional annotations in different conditions. PIGNON does not assess the statistical significance of the differential expression of individual proteins, but rather maps protein differential expression levels onto a protein-protein interaction network and measures the clustering of proteins from a given functional annotation within the network. This process allows the detection of functional annotations for which the proteins are differentially expressed and grouped in the network. A Monte-Carlo sampling approach is used to assess the clustering significance of proteins in an expression-weighted network. When applied to a quantitative proteomics analysis of different molecular subtypes of breast cancer, PIGNON detects Gene Ontology terms that are both significantly clustered in a protein-protein interaction network and differentially expressed across different breast cancer subtypes. PIGNON identified functional annotations that are dysregulated and clustered within the network between the HER2+, triple negative and hormone receptor positive subtypes. We show that PIGNON's results are complementary to those of state-of-the-art functional enrichment analyses and that it highlights functional annotations missed by standard approaches. Furthermore, PIGNON detects functional annotations that have been previously associated with specific breast cancer subtypes.\nPIGNON provides an alternative to functional enrichment analyses and a more comprehensive characterization of quantitative datasets. Hence, it contributes to yielding a better understanding of dysregulated functions and processes in biological samples under different experimental conditions.\n", "authors": "Rachel Nadeau,Anastasiia Byvsheva,Mathieu Lavallée-Adam", "pmid": "34088263", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:32.972Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:32.972Z", "publish_date": "2021-06-04", "keywords": "Breast cancer", "slug": "pignon-a-protein-protein-interaction-guided-functi", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 2383, "fields": {"title": "Associations between handgrip strength and hypertension in relation to circulating CD34-positive cell levels among Japanese older men: a cross-sectional study.", "body": "\nA positive association between handgrip strength and blood pressure has been reported.

Ambient air has become the most important pathway for the transfer of PCDDs/PCDFs from emission sources to the environment. This review intends to summarise the information available on atmospheric PCDDs/PCDFs in the countries of Southeast Asia to provide a detailed description of the trends in PCDDs/PCDFs emissions, key sources, and levels in urban, rural, and industrial air as reported in peer-reviewed literature since 2000 and by the United Nations Environment Programme. As the largest country in Southeast Asia, Indonesia is the major PCDDs/PCDFs emitter, accounting for 72.81% of the total release of PCDDs/PCDFs in the air from all available inventories in this region, while Brunei Darussalam is the lowest emitter, contributing to less than 0.02%. Open burning processes have become the largest source of ambient PCDDs/PCDFs in the region (69.62%), followed by waste incineration (10.69%), and ferrous and non-ferrous metal production (8.78%). PCDDs/PCDFs levels in rural areas ranged between 10 and 38 fg TEQ m-3; however, where open burning waste has occurred, the levels rose to 12-29 times higher. In urban areas, ambient levels were 15 times greater than in rural areas, varying from 23 to 565 fg TEQ m-3. Atmospheric concentrations near industrial palm oil and waste incinerator sites were between 64 and 1530 fg TEQ m-3. The non-cancer risk of ambient exposure to PCDDs/PCDFs through inhalation is low among populations near facilities emitting PCDDs/PCDFs. The lack of local technical capacity, the high economic costs, and the lack of established human resource capacities have been the major challenges in conducting ambient PCDDs/PCDFs studies in most countries in the region.\nCopyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Due to the limited regenerative capacity of adult hearts, the damage caused by heart injury cannot be reversed and eventually progress into heart failure. In need of cardiovascular disease treatment, many therapies aimed at either cell transplantation or cell regeneration have been proposed. Direct reprogramming of somatic cells into induced cardiomyocytes (iCMs) is considered to be a promising strategy for regenerative medicine. The induction of cardiomyocytes from non-myocytes can be achieved efficiently via ectopic expression of reprogramming factors both in vitro and in vivo in the mouse model, however, the generation of human induced cardiomyocyte-like cells (hiCMs) remains challenging. The inefficiency of hiCMs production called for the identification of the additional epigenetic memories in non-myocytes which might be damping the hiCM reprogramming. Here, we conducted an unbiased loss-of-function screening focusing on epigenetic regulators and identified enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) as an important epigenetic barrier during hiCM reprogramming. We found that the removal of EZH2 via genetic knockdown or treatment of EZH2 selective degrader significantly increased the hiCM reprogramming efficiency and led to profound activation of cardiac genes and repression of collagen and extracellular matrix genes. Furthermore, EZH2 inhibitors targeting its catalytic activity also promotes hiCM reprogramming, suggesting that EZH2 may restrain cardiac conversion through H3K27me3-mediated gene repression. Indeed, genomic profiling of H3K27me3 revealed a subset of cardiac genes that remain repressed with high levels of H3K27me3 despite of the delivery of the reprogramming factors. Inhibition of EZH2, however, leads to reduced H3K27me3 occupancy and robust activation of these cardiac genes. Taken together, our data suggested that EZH2 inhibition facilitates the activation of cardiac genes in fibroblasts and eases the production of hiCMs.\nCopyright © 2021 The Author(s).

SKOV-3 and OVCAR-3 cells (1 × 105/ml) were cultured in DMEM medium and treated with exendin-4 in the presence or absence of chloroquine (CQ), an autophagy inhibitor. In some cases, cells were also treated with exendin- 4 with or without pre-treatment with compound C (CC), an AMPK inhibitor, or insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), a PI3K/Akt activator. Exendin-4 increased expression of beclin-1 and LC3I/II, suppressed expression of p62, reduced cell survival, migration, and invasion, and increased cell apoptosis and LDH release in both SKOV-3 and OVCAR-3 cells. Besides, exendin-4 reduced phosphorylation of mTORC1, 6SK, 4E-BP1, and Akt but increased phosphorylation of AMPK in both cell lines. These effects were associated with down-regulation of Bcl-2, suppression of nuclear phosphorylation of NF-κB p65, and increased expression of Bax and cleaved caspases 3/8. Chloroquine completely prevented the inhibitory effects of exendin-4 on the cell survival, Bcl-2, NF-κB, and cell invasiveness and abolished its stimulation of cell apoptosis and LDH release.

Since cancer cells demonstrate increased mitochondrial oxidative stress relative to normal cells, we hypothesized that a KD may selectively enhance metabolic oxidative stress in head and neck cancer cells, sensitizing them to radiation and platinum-based chemotherapy without causing increased toxicity in surrounding normal tissues. This hypothesis was tested in preclinical murine xenografts and in a phase 1 clinical trial (NCT01975766). In this study, mice bearing human head and neck cancer xenografts (FaDu) were fed either standard mouse chow or KetoCal® KD (90% fat, 8% carbohydrate, 2% protein) and exposed to ionizing radiation. Tumors were harvested from mice to test for glutathione, a biomarker of oxidative stress. In parallel, patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer were enrolled in a phase 1 clinical trial where they consumed KD and received radiation with concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy. Subjects consumed KetoCal KD via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube and were also allowed to orally consume water, sugar-free drinks, and foods approved by a dietitian. Oxidative stress markers including protein carbonyls and total glutathione were assessed in patient blood samples both pre-KD and while consuming the KD. Mice bearing FaDu xenografts that received radiation and KD demonstrated a slight improvement in tumor growth rate and survival compared to mice that received radiation alone; however a variation in responses was seen dependent on the fatty acid composition of the diet. In the phase 1 clinical trial, a total of twelve patients were enrolled in the study. Four patients completed five weeks of the KD as per protocol (with variance in compliance). Eight patients did not tolerate the diet with concurrent radiation and platinum-chemotherapy (5 were patient decision and 3 were removed from study due to toxicity). The median number of days consuming a KD in patients who did not complete the study was 5.5 (range: 2-8 days). Reasons for discontinuation included \"stress of diet compliance\" (1 patient), grade 2 nausea (3 patients), and grade 3 fatigue (1 patient). Three patients were removed from the trial due to dose-limiting toxicities including: grade 4 hyperuricemia (2 patients) and grade 3 acute pancreatitis (1 patient). Median weight loss was 2.95% for the KD-tolerant group and 7.92% for patients who did not tolerate the diet. In conclusion, the ketogenic diet shows promise as a treatment combined with radiation in preclinical mouse head and neck cancer xenografts.

Therefore, exploration of the role of autophagy-related genes (ARGs) in SKCM is necessary.\nDifferential expression autophagy-related genes (DEARGs) were first analysed. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate the expression of DEARGs and prognosis of SKCM. Further, the expression levels of prognosis-related DEARGs were verified by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. Finally, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms of SKCM.\nFive ARGs (APOL1, BIRC5, EGFR, TP63, and SPNS1) were positively correlated with the prognosis of SKCM. IHC verified the results of the differential expression of these 5 ARGs in the bioinformatics analysis. According to the receiver operating characteristic curve, the signature had a good performance at predicting overall survival in SKCM. The signature could classify SKCM patients into high-risk or low-risk groups according to distinct overall survival. The nomogram confirmed that the risk score has a particularly large impact on the prognosis of SKCM. Calibration plot displayed excellent agreement between nomogram predictions and actual observations. Principal component analysis indicated that patients in the high-risk group could be distinguished from those in low-risk group. Results of GSEA indicated that the low-risk group is enriched with aggressiveness-related pathways such as phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase B and mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling pathways.\nOur study identified a 5-gene signature. It revealed the mechanisms of autophagy that lead to the progression of SKCM and established a prognostic nomogram that can predict overall survival of patients with SKCM. The findings of this study provide novel insights into the relationship between ARGs and prognosis of SKCM.\nCopyright © 2021 the Author(s).

Laparoscopic techniques are popular, and the efficacy and safety of laparoscopic rectal surgery have been confirmed. However, postoperative anastomotic leakage is a common, severe complication that leads to high mortality. Thus, early diagnosis of anastomotic leakage is important for reducing clinical consequences.The aim of this study was to determine whether C-reactive protein (CRP) is a good predictor of anastomotic leakage in laparoscopic transabdominal rectal resection.Our retrospective study involved a series of 196 rectal cancer patients who underwent laparoscopic transabdominal rectal resection without ileostomy between May 2013 and April 2015 at the Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhejiang University College of Medicine. The following patient data were collected: demographic data, manifestations of the complication, CRP levels and neutrophil percentage during the first 7 postoperative days.Anastomotic leakage was detected in 11 patients (5.6%). Each group showed significant differences (P < .05) in CRP levels on postoperative days 3 to 7; compared with other groups, the anastomotic leakage group showed significant differences in CRP levels (P < .05) on postoperative day 6. When patients were divided into groups with or without anastomotic leakage, CRP was a reliable predictor on postoperative days 4 to 7 (P < .05, area under the curve > 0.800). The best combination was CRP on postoperative day 6 (area under the curve = 0.932) with a cut-off of 76.6 mg/L, resulting in a sensitivity of 83.3%, a specificity of 94.6% and a negative predictive value of 99%.CRP is a reliable predictor of anastomotic leakage after laparoscopic transabdominal rectal resection surgery.

However, MetS led to higher risk of advanced colorectal adenoma in men than in women. Regarding the effect of each component of MetS on colorectal adenoma, abnormal waist circumference and hypertriglyceridemia led to an elevated risk of colorectal adenoma in both genders. A rising risk of colorectal adenoma among females was noted in those with a moderately higher level of glycemia (100-125 mg/dL, aHR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.12-1.85). Hypertriglyceridemia and high blood pressure were associated with an increased risk of advance colorectal adenoma in males.Both male and female subjects with MetS had a higher risk of colorectal adenoma. The contributions from individual components of MetS varied by gender. These findings suggest that the possible risk reduction of colorectal adenoma through metabolic syndrome-based lifestyle modifications may differ between genders.\nCopyright © 2021 the Author(s).

In this study, we describe the design and characterization of a proton beam stereotactic radiosurgery system that can be adopted by existing passive scattering systems. This system utilizes a helmet-like device in which patient-specific brass apertures required for final beam collimation are positioned on a scaffold that is separate from the treatment gantry. The proton snout is then fitted with a generic aperture to focus the primary proton beam onto the patient specific apertures that are in the helmetlike device. The patient-specific apertures can all be placed at the start of the treatment, thus treatment with multiple beams can be accomplished without the delay of switching the apertures. In this report we describe a prototype design of this collimation system and dosimetric testing to verify efficacy. Subsequently, we describe a custom 3D printing of a prototype device and report on overall localization accuracy using Winston-Lutz tests. Our results show that it is possible to develop an add-on device for proton beam radiosurgery that is safe and efficient and capable of wide adoption on existing proton delivery systems.\n© 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd.\n", "authors": "Twyla Willoughby,Amanda Boczkowski,Sanford L Meeks,Francis J Bova,Omar A Zeidan,Kevin Erhart,Patrick Kelly", "pmid": "34087816", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:33.083Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:33.084Z", "publish_date": "2021-06-04", "keywords": "Proton Radiation Therapy", "slug": "design-and-characterization-of-a-prototype-tertiar", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 2416, "fields": {"title": "Learning-based dose prediction for pancreatic stereotactic body radiation therapy using dual pyramid adversarial network.", "body": "\nTreatment planning for pancreatic cancer stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is very challenging owing to vast spatial variations and close proximity of many organs-at-risk. Recently, deep learning (DL)-based methods have been applied in dose prediction tasks of various treatment sites with the aim of relieving planning challenges. Limited investigations, however, have been reported on DL-based dose prediction for pancreatic cancer SBRT. This study aims to further current knowledge in DL-based dose prediction tasks by implementing and demonstrating the feasibility of a new dual pyramid networks (DPNs) integrated DL-model for predicting dose distributions of pancreatic SBRT. The proposed framework is composed of four parts: CT-only feature pyramid network (FPN), contour-only FPN, late fusion network and adversarial network. Combination of mean absolute error, gradient difference error, histogram matching, and adversarial loss is used for supervision. The performance of proposed model was demonstrated for pancreatic cancer SBRT plans for doses prescribed between 33 and 50 Gy over five fractions to up to three planning target volumes (PTV). Five-fold cross-validation was performed on 30 patients and another 20 patients were used as holdout tests. Predicted plans were compared with clinically approved plans through dose-volume parameters. The proposed framework was able to predict 87% and 91% of clinically relevant dose parameters for cross-validation sets and holdout sets, respectively, without any significant differences (P > 0.05). For the parameters with significant differences (P < 0.05), the predicted doses to the duodenum and spinal cord were lower in comparison to the clinical plans. The proposed model was also able to predict the intentional hotspots as feature characteristics of SBRT plans. Overall, the proposed model was able to predict doses to cases with both single and multiple PTVs. In conclusion, the DPN integrated DL-model demonstrated good overall plan quality and dose prediction accuracy for pancreatic cancer SBRT.\n© 2021 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.\n", "authors": "Shadab Momin,Yang Lei,Tonghe Wang,Jiahan Zhang,Justin Roper,Jeffrey D Bradley,Walter J Curran,Pretesh Patel,Tian Liu,Xiaofeng Yang", "pmid": "34087807", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:33.087Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:33.087Z", "publish_date": "2021-06-04", "keywords": "Deep Learning", "slug": "learning-based-dose-prediction-for-pancreatic-ster", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 2417, "fields": {"title": "Risk of Cancer-Specific Death for Patients Diagnosed With Neuroendocrine Tumors: A Population-Based Analysis.", "body": "\nAlthough patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are known to have prolonged overall survival, the contribution of cancer-specific and noncancer deaths is undefined. This study examined cancer-specific and noncancer death after NET diagnosis.\nWe conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study of adult patients with NETs from 2001 through 2015. Using competing risks methods, we estimated the cumulative incidence of cancer-specific and noncancer death and stratified by primary NET site and metastatic status. Subdistribution hazard models examined prognostic factors.\nAmong 8,607 included patients, median follow-up was 42 months (interquartile range, 17-82). Risk of cancer-specific death was higher than that of noncancer death, at 27.3% (95% CI, 26.3%-28.4%) and 5.6% (95% CI, 5.1%-6.1%), respectively, at 5 years. Cancer-specific deaths largely exceeded noncancer deaths in synchronous and metachronous metastatic NETs. Patterns varied by primary tumor site, with highest risks of cancer-specific death in bronchopulmonary and pancreatic NETs. For nonmetastatic gastric, small intestine, colonic, and rectal NETs, the risk of noncancer death exceeded that of cancer-specific deaths. Advancing age, higher material deprivation, and metastases were independently associated with higher hazards, and female sex and high comorbidity burden with lower hazards of cancer-specific death.\nAmong all NETs, the risk of dying of cancer was higher than that of dying of other causes. Heterogeneity exists by primary NET site. Some patients with nonmetastatic NETs are more likely to die of noncancer causes than of cancer causes. This information is important for counseling, decision-making, and design of future trials. Cancer-specific mortality should be included in outcomes when assessing treatment strategies.\n", "authors": "Julie Hallet,Calvin Law,Simron Singh,Alyson Mahar,Sten Myrehaug,Victoria Zuk,Haoyu Zhao,Wing Chan,Angela Assal,Natalie Coburn", "pmid": "34087785", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:33.093Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:33.093Z", "publish_date": "2021-06-04", "keywords": "", "slug": "risk-of-cancer-specific-death-for-patients-diagnos", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 2418, "fields": {"title": "Correction: Epigenetic Regulation of NAMPT by NAMPT-AS Drives Metastatic Progression in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.", "body": "", "authors": "Hanwen Zhang,Ning Zhang,Ying Liu,Peng Su,Yiran Liang,Yaming Li,Xiaolong Wang,Tong Chen,Xiaojin Song,Yuting Sang,Yi Duan,Jiashu Zhang,Lijuan Wang,Bing Chen,Wenjing Zhao,Haiyang Guo,Zhaojian Liu,Guohong Hu,Qifeng Yang", "pmid": "34087784", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:33.095Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:33.095Z", "publish_date": null, "keywords": "", "slug": "correction-epigenetic-regulation-of-nampt-by-nampt", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 2419, "fields": {"title": "Correction: Mitochondrial DNA Repair through OGG1 Activity Attenuates Breast Cancer Progression and Metastasis.", "body": "", "authors": "Larysa V Yuzefovych,Andrea G Kahn,Michele A Schuler,Lars Eide,Ritu Arora,Glenn L Wilson,Ming Tan,Lyudmila I Rachek", "pmid": "34087783", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:33.098Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:33.098Z", "publish_date": null, "keywords": "", "slug": "correction-mitochondrial-dna-repair-through-ogg1-a", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 2420, "fields": {"title": "To Go or Not to Go?-Targeting Tregs Traveling in Tumors.", "body": "\nRegulatory T cells (Treg) are one of the major impediments to effective antitumor immunity and successful immunotherapy. Elevated intratumoral Treg frequencies, observed in a variety of malignancies, have been associated with poor prognosis. In this issue of Cancer Research, two studies underscore the potential of harnessing the unique migratory profile of tumor-infiltrating Tregs to selectively eliminate these cells without compromising peripheral tolerance. Both studies identify surface migratory receptors, CCR8 by Campbell and colleagues and GPR15 by Adamczyk and colleagues, as selective markers of intratumoral Tregs in tumor-bearing mice and patients with cancer. Genetic deletion of GPR15 or antibody-mediated depletion of CCR8 was found to preferentially decrease tumor-infiltrating Tregs and substantially delayed tumor progression. Together, these two studies highlight the significance of migratory molecules in intratumoral Tregs and propose two potential selective targets for preferential elimination of tumor-associated \"pathogenic\" Tregs, which can be hijacked to enhance the response to immunotherapy.See related articles by Adamczyk et al., p. 2970 and Campbell et al., p. 2983.\n©2021 American Association for Cancer Research.\n", "authors": "Sanjukta Chakraborty,Roberta Zappasodi", "pmid": "34087782", "created_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:33.101Z", "update_date": "2021-06-06T11:24:33.101Z", "publish_date": null, "keywords": "", "slug": "to-go-or-not-to-go-targeting-tregs-traveling-in-tu", "tags": []}}, {"model": "SWE573_Project.articlemodel", "pk": 2421, "fields": {"title": "Loss of Gas7 Is a Key Metastatic Switch in Neuroblastoma.", "body": "\nMetastatic spread to distant tissues and organs is responsible for most cancer-related mortalities.

However, whether SAMMSON regulates the response of mutant BRAF melanoma cells to RAF inhibitors remains unknown. In this work, we showed that SAMMSON is rapidly induced upon inhibition of ERK signaling, and SAMMSON overexpression conferred resistance to vemurafenib-induced cytotoxicity in melanoma cells. SOX10 mediated transcriptional induction of SAMMSON by vemurafenib, and SOX10 sumoylation at K55 was essential for this function. In addition, depletion of SAMMSON activated p53 signaling, which is dependent on the SAMMSON-interacting protein CARF. Depletion of SAMMSON sensitized mutant BRAF melanoma cells to RAF inhibitors in vitro and in vivo, while CARF knockdown reversed the enhanced sensitivity. In summary, these findings suggest that SAMMSON may function as a new mediator of adaptive resistance to RAF inhibitors in melanoma by modulating CARF-p53 signaling.

The first, often referred to as histone recycling or parental histone segregation, is characterized by the transfer of parental histones located ahead of replication forks onto nascent DNA. The second, known as de novo chromatin assembly, consists of the deposition of new histone molecules onto nascent DNA. Because these two processes occur at all replication forks, their potential to influence a multitude of DNA repair and DNA damage tolerance mechanisms is considerable. The purpose of this review is to provide a description of parental histone segregation and de novo chromatin assembly, and to illustrate how these processes influence cellular responses to DNA replication roadblocks.\nCopyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

The inquiry attracted widespread media coverage and the government offered women free, out of programme screening. We investigated whether the controversy led to an increase in referrals based on clinical suspicion and the impact on waiting times for abnormal cytology.\nA retrospective cross-sectional analysis was performed, including all colposcopy referrals to The National Maternity Hospital, Dublin, before (March 2016-2018) and after (March 2018-2020) the media coverage. Chi-squared (χ2) and independent one-tailed t-tests were used to perform between-group analyses.\nPost-controversy, suspicious cervix referrals increased (10.1 %-14.2 %; p = 0.037 × 10-27), as did colposcopic impression of CIN (p = 0.000000016). While an increase in CIN1 histology (18.5 %-30.3 %) was diagnosed, a decrease in high-risk CIN2 (10 % to 8.6 %), CIN3 (6.2 % to 2.9 %), AIS (1.2 % to 0.3 %) and invasive cancer (2.8 % to 1.2 %; p = 0.0058 × 10-9) were diagnosed. Across all grades of cytological abnormality, significantly fewer patients were reviewed in the recommended waiting time post-controversy. Half of delayed abnormal cytology referrals had high-grade changes.\nThis study highlights the profound impact that the CervicalCheck Controversy had on the women attending colposcopy and clinicians performing the screening tests, and the direct impact on women with confirmed cytological abnormalities. The increase in suspicious cervix referrals reflects a lack of confidence in both clinical practice and screening test results. The importance of public trust in the effective delivery of screening services cannot be ignored. Increased resources are required to ensure all women are seen within recommended time frames. Heightened anxiety and increased surveillance does not necessarily lead to better clinical outcomes for patients but can result in unnecessary distress for low-risk patients and delays to diagnosis for high-risk patients with concerning abnormalities.\nCopyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

There are many reasons for the partial success of cancer translational research. One of these can be the predominance of certain paradigms that potentially narrowed the vision in interpreting cancer. The main paradigm to explain carcinogenesis is based on DNA mutations, which is well interpreted by the somatic mutation theory (SMT). However, a different theory claims that cancer is instead a tissue disease as proposed by the Tissue Organization Field Theory (TOFT). Here, we propose new hypotheses to explain the origin and pathogenesis of cancer. In this perspective, the systemic-evolutionary theory of cancer (SETOC) is discussed as well as how the microenvironment affects the adaptation of transformed cells and the reversion to a unicellular-like or embryo-like phenotype.\nCopyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

In Kuwait, the median concentration of total PBDEs (Ʃ14- PBDEs) was 408.55 μg PBDEs/kg dust in houses and twice as high in cars (838.52 μg PBDEs/kg dust), while total PAHs (Ʃ16-PAHs) were similar in houses (992.81 μg PAHs/kg) and cars (900.42 μg PAHs/kg). The PBDEs and PAHs concentrations in indoor dust were related to house age and square footage, car model year, and natural ventilation. Furthermore, a higher PBDEs concentration was associated with electronic devices that operate continuously, furniture containing foam treated with PBDEs, and cars that are parked outdoors, since PBDEs tend to be volatilized under these conditions. The PAHs concentration in indoor dust increased with smoking and proximity to major roads and industrial facilities, which are major PAHs sources. The hazard quotient and total cancer risk for PBDEs in indoor dust were within safe limits, but indoor dust with higher PAHs concentrations had hazard quotients from 5.51 to 11.23 and total cancer risk of 10-3 for adults and children. We conclude that exposure to PAHs-contaminated indoor dust from houses and cars where smoking occurs can increase the cancer risk of adults and children.\nCopyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

These defective ribosome products (DRiPs) have been implicated in early alert of the immune system about impending infections. Interferons are important cytokines, produced in response to viral infection, they modulate cellular metabolism and gene expression patterns, and increase the presentation of MHC molecules, and induce rapid degradation of proteins and cell-surface presentation of their derived MHC peptides, thereby contributing to the battle against pathogen infections. This study evaluated the role of interferons in the induction of rapid degradation of defective ribosome products (DRiPs) to modulate the repertoire of DRiPs-derived MHC peptides. Cultured human breast cancer cells were treated with interferons and the rates of synthesis and degradation of cellular protein and their degradation products were determined by LC-MS/MS analysis, following the rates of incorporation of heavy stable isotope-labeled amino acids (dynamic-SILAC) at several time points after the interferon application. Large numbers of MHC peptides that incorporated the heavy amino acids faster than their source proteins indicated that DRiP-peptides were abundant in the MHC peptidome; interferon treatment increased by about twofold their relative proportions in the peptidome. Examples for such typical DRiPome-derived MHC peptides were from the surplus subunits of the proteasome and ribosome, which are degraded due to the transition to immunoproteasomes, and to a new composition of ribosomes incorporating protein subunits that are induced by the interferon. We conclude that degradation of surplus subunits induced by the interferon is a major source for DRiP-MHC peptides, a phenomenon relevant to coping with viral infections, where a rapid presentation of MHC peptides derived from excess viral proteins may help to alert the immune system about the impending infection.\nCopyright © 2021 The Authors.

Nanohydrogels are highly appealing \"smart\" biocompatible and biodegradable vehicles for either local or systemic delivery of bioactive compounds.

Cabazitaxel-loaded nanogels showed preferential tumor accumulation, and administration of nanogels produced durable tumor regression in a docetaxel-resistant cervical tumor xenograft-bearing mouse model. More significantly, nanogel-based therapy was proven to demonstrate a higher safety profile than solution-based free cabazitaxel.

The increases in matrix stiffness during tissue development are often accompanied by the accumulation of extracellular matrices (e.g., collagen, hyaluronic acid (HA)), a phenomenon that has received little attention in the development of dynamic hydrogels. In this contribution, we present a gelatin-based cell-laden hydrogel system capable of being dynamically stiffened while accumulating HA, a key glycosaminoglycans (GAG) increasingly deposited by stromal cells during tumor progression. Central to this strategy is the synthesis of a dually-modified gelatin macromer - gelatin-norbornene-carbohydrazide (GelNB-CH), which is susceptible to both thiol-norbornene photopolymerization and hydrazone click chemistry. We demonstrate that the crosslinking density of cell-laden thiol-norbornene hydrogels can be dynamically tuned via simple incubation with aldehyde-bearing macromers (e.g., oxidized dextran (oDex) or oHA). The GelNB-CH hydrogel system is highly cytocompatible, as demonstrated by in situ encapsulation of pancreatic cancer cells (PCC) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF). The unique dynamic stiffening scheme provides a platform to study tandem accumulation of HA and elevation in matrix stiffness in the pancreatic tumor microenvironment.\nCopyright © 2021.

We successfully designed and synthesized a new mercury-based supramolecular polymer, Hg-BU-PPG, containing an oligomeric polypropylene glycol backbone and pH-sensitive uracil-mercury-uracil (U-Hg-U) linkages. This multifunctional metallo-supramolecular material spontaneously self-organizes into nanosized spherical micelles in aqueous solution. The micelles possess several attractive properties, including desired long-term structural stability in serum-rich conditions, unique fluorescence behavior and highly sensitive, well-controlled pH-responsiveness. Interestingly, Hg-BU-PPG micelles exhibited strong, selective cytotoxic effects towards cancer cells in vitro, without harming normal cells. The highly selective cytotoxicity can be attributed to rapid dissociation of the U-Hg-U complexes within the micelles in the mildly acidic intracellular pH of cancer cells, followed by release of inherently toxic mercury ions. Importantly, fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry clearly demonstrated that Hg-BU-PPG selectively entered the cancer cells via endocytosis and rapidly promoted massive apoptotic cell death. In contrast, internalization of Hg-BU-PPG by normal cells was limited, resulting in high biocompatibility and no cytotoxic effects. Thus, this newly discovered 'cytotoxicity-concealing' supramolecular system could represent a viable route to enhance the safety and efficacy of cancer therapy and bioimaging via a strategy that does not require incorporation of anticancer drugs and fluorescent probes.\nCopyright © 2021.

However, the role of ketogenesis in the TNFα-mediated pathological process is not entirely known. Here, we showed the regulation and role of HMGCS2, the rate-limiting enzyme of ketogenesis, in TNFα-induced apoptotic and inflammatory responses in intestinal epithelial cells. Treatment with TNFα dose-dependently decreased protein and mRNA expression of HMGCS2 and its product, βHB production in human colon cancer cell lines HT29 and Caco2 cells and mouse small intestinal organoids. Moreover, the repressed level of HMGCS2 protein was found in intestinal epithelium of IBD patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis as compared with normal tissues. Furthermore, knockdown of HMGCS2 enhanced and in contrast, HMGCS2 overexpression attenuated, the TNFα-induced apoptosis and expression of pro-inflammatory chemokines (CXCL1-3) in HT29, Caco2 cells and DLD1 cells, respectively. Treatment with βHB or rosiglitazone, an agonist of PPARγ, which increases ketogenesis, attenuated TNFα-induced apoptosis in the intestinal epithelial cells. Finally, HMGCS2 knockdown enhanced TNFα-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. In addition, hydrogen peroxide, the major ROS contributing to intestine injury, decreased HMGCS2 expression and βHB production in the intestinal cells and mouse organoids.

Here we analyzed the therapeutic effect of intermittent calorie restriction with a fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) on dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced chronic IBD model in mice. Two cycles of FMD was administered after IBD symptoms occurred in the mice. FMD administration significantly reduced the score of disease activity index. FMD reversed DSS-mediated shortening of colon length, infiltration of lymphocytes in the crypt of colon, and accumulation of CD4+ cells in the colon and small intestine. The expression of an inflammation marker NLRP3 was also reduced by FMD administration. The percentage of CD4+ T cells in both peripheral blood and spleen was also reduced by FMD. In addition, FMD application reversed DSS-mediated reduction in intestinal stem cell marker Lgr5, while the cell proliferation markers Ki67 and PCNA were increased by FMD. Taken together, these results indicate that in the mouse model of IBD, application of the FMD can effectively ameliorate the symptoms and pathogenesis of IBD through reducing the inflammation of intestine and promoting the regeneration and repair of the damaged intestinal epithelium.\nCopyright © 2021.

A better understanding of this side effect enables early recognition, diagnosis and management in clinical practice. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of literature published on ClinicalTrials.gov, Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane Library to assess the differences in cutaneous irAEs among ICIs, the effect from dosage and combined treatment on the incidence, and the predictive values for prognosis. A total of 46 eligible RCTs involving 28569 patients were included. This study indicates that cutaneous irAEs are dose-independent and agent-specific immune reactions with the highest risk observed in CTLA-4 blockade and might not a surrogate prognostic indicator.\nCopyright © 2021.

Further risk stratification is essentially needed. Here by reviewing the latest literature, we summarized the characteristics of CEBPA mutation profiles and clinical features, with a special intention of dissecting the heterogeneity within the seemingly homogeneous AML with bi-allelic CEBPA mutations. Specifically, non-classical CEBPA mutation, miscellaneous companion genetic aberrations and the presence of germline CEBPA mutation are three major sources of heterogeneity. Identifying these factors can help us predict patients at a higher risk of relapse, for whom aggressive treatment may be recommended. Novel therapeutic approaches regarding manipulating potentially druggable targets as well as the debate over post remission consolidation regimens has also been discussed.\nCopyright © 2021.

We systematically searched MEDLINE Ovid, Cochrane Library, IPA, CINAHL, Web of Science and ProQuest Dissertations for studies evaluating eribulin versus non-eribulin regimens in LABC/MBC till January 15, 2021. Primary effectiveness and safety outcomes were overall survival (OS) and adverse events (AE), respectively. Hazard ratios (HR) and relative risks (RR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using fixed or random-effects meta-analyses. Of 1183 publications identified, 13 studies were included in this review. Eribulin based therapy showed significantly increased OS [HR (95 % CI) = 0.77 (0.67-0.88)] compared to non-eribulin in both main and sensitivity analyses, as well as subgroup analyses according to receptor expression and line of therapy. Incidence of all-grade neutropenia was the only significant AE in eribulin than non-eribulin groups. Eribulin has a manageable toxicity profile and provides significant survival benefit in LABC/MBC patients.\nCopyright © 2021.

Andrographolide-derived SRJ09 and SRJ23 were reported to exhibit potent, selective inhibitory activities against colon and prostate cancer cells, respectively. In this study, previously developed resistant colon (HCT-116rst09) and prostate (PC-3rst23) cancer cell lines were used to elucidate the molecular mechanisms contributing to chemoresistance. Cytotoxic effects of SRJ09 and SRJ23 on both parental and resistant cells were investigated. Cell cycle distributions in HCT-116rst09 cells following SRJ09 treatment were analysed using flow cytometry. Whole-genome microarray analysis was performed on both parental and resistant cells to obtain differential gene expression profiles. Microarray data were subjected to protein-protein interaction network, functional enrichment, and pathway analyses. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to validate the changes in expression levels of selected genes. Besides morphological changes, HCT-116rst09 cells showed 7.0-fold resistance to SRJ09 while PC-3rst23 cells displayed a 5.5-fold resistance to SRJ23, as compared with their respective parental cells. G0/G1-phase cell cycle arrest was observed in HCT-116rst09 cells upon SRJ09 treatment. Collectively, 77 and 21 genes were found differentially modulated in HCT-116rst09 and PC-3rst23 cells, respectively. Subsequent bioinformatics analysis revealed several genes associated with FGFR4 and PI3K pathways, and cancer stemness, were chemoresistance mediators in HCT-116rst09 cells. RT-PCR confirmed the HMOX1 upregulation and ATG12 downregulation protected the PC-3rst23 cells from SRJ23 cytotoxicity. In conclusion, acquired chemoresistance to SRJ09 and SRJ23 in colon and prostate cancer cells, respectively, could be attributed to the alterations in the expression of genes such as those related to PI3K and autophagy pathways.\nCopyright © 2021.
